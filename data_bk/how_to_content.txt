split text into sentences (separated by dot) and separate each into a new line
remove titles, page numbers, headings, appendix, etc.
take care of abbrieviations that you may have encountered in the index or any that you encounter during processing this text.
regex to split text by periods followed by a space. Find \.\s+ replace by \.\n (This also puts new line after abbrieviations)
regex to combine multiple parts of sentences that were on different lines to a single line - Find ([^\.])\n replace  (space). Note that this does not handle abbrieviations.

Further possible actions - separate text into page numbers ? Without this, the page number for index has no meaning
