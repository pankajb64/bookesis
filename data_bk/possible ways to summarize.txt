Follow these approaches to create summaries, for each step use ROUGE-1 metric to evaluation P, R and F measures. Try to create a dataset on which to test and obtain a set of summaries to compare against. Try to tweak parameters as well as see if that changes things. At the end you may want to evaluate using ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4 and other measures (BLEU maybe?)
Filter sentences containing index - then do extractive summarization.
Filter sentences containing index, but for each chosen sentence also include previous and next sentence. Then first do an abstractive summarization of this triplet. Finally do an extractive summarization.
Create a list of index words. For each word, find the sentences where it is being used. Then create a summary for each sentence (abstractive/extractive). Create final summaries from these summaries by choosing the k most important index words and accumulating their summaries (either one after other or in round robin fashion).
Repeat above step but for each index word, include previous and next sentence along with the chosen sentence.
Repeat above two steps, but while creating summary instead of choosing k words, go in a weighted round robin fashion around all words (with more sentences belong to more important words). (Is this any different from the other approaches?)
