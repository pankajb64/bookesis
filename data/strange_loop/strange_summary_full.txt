All human beings  at least all sufficiently large-souled ones  have to make up their minds about such matters as the swatting of mosquitoes or flies, the setting of mousetraps, the eating of rabbits or lobsters or turkeys or pigs, perhaps even of dogs or horses, the purchase of mink stoles or ivory statues, the usage of leather suitcases or crocodile belts, even the penicillinbased attack on swarms of bacteria that have invaded their body, and on and on.
What has happened, however, is that a dynamic, snowballing entity has come into existence that over a period of years will be capable of developing a complex set of internal structures or patterns  and the presence, to a higher and higher degree, of those intricate patterns is what would endow that entity (or rather, the enormously more complex entities into which it slowly metamorphoses, step by step) with an ever-larger value along the Huneker soul-scale, homing in on a value somewhere in the vicinity of 100.
In short, I would here argue, echoing and generalizing the provocative statement by James Huneker, that souledness is by no means an offon, black-and-white, discrete variable having just two possible states like a bit, a pixel, or a light bulb, but rather is a shaded, blurry numerical variable that ranges continuously across different species and varieties of object, and that also can rise or fall over time as a result of the growth or decay, within the entity in question, of a special kind of subtle pattern (the elucidation of whose nature will keep us busy for much of this book).
I would also argue that most peoples largely unconscious prejudices about whether to eat or not to eat this or that food, whether to buy or not to buy this or that article of clothing, whether to swat or not to swat this or that insect, whether to root or not to root for this or that species of robot in a sci-fi film, whether to be sad or not to be sad if a human character in a film or a novel meets with a violent end, whether to claim or not to claim that a particular senescent person is no longer there, and so forth, reflect precisely this kind of numerical continuum in their minds, whether they admit it or not.
Just as the notion of gene as an invisible entity that enabled the passing-on of traits from parents to progeny was proposed and studied scientifically long before any physical object could be identified as an actual carrier of such traits, and just as the notion of atoms as the building blocks of all physical objects was proposed and studied scientifically long before individual atoms were isolated and internally probed, so any of the notions listed above might legitimately be considered as invisible structures for brain researchers to try to pinpoint physically in the human brain.
In a ploy that, in my opinion, should fool only third-graders but that unfortunately takes in great multitudes of his professional colleagues, he pokes merciless fun at the idea that thinking could ever be implemented in a system made of such far-fetched physical substrates as toilet paper and pebbles (the tape would be an infinite roll of toilet paper, and a pebble on a square of paper would act as the dot in a cell), or Tinkertoys, or a vast assemblage of beer cans and ping-pong balls bashing together.
And they also interact with the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise advance in evolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary scene yet, including the emergence of the living cell.
Thinkodynamics and Statistical Mentalics It thus comes as no news to anyone that different levels of description have different kinds of utility, depending on the purpose and the context, and I have accordingly summarized my view of this simple truth as it applies to the world of thinking and the brain: Thinkodynamics is explained by statistical mentalics, as well as its flipped-around version: Statistical mentalics can be bypassed by talking at the level of thinkodynamics.
However, as neurologist Sperry made very clear in the passage cited above, there is not, in the brain, just one single natural upward jump, as there is in a gas, all the way from the basic constituents to the whole thing; rather, there are many way-stations in the upward passage from mentalics to thinkodynamics, and this means that it is particularly hard for us to see, or even to imagine, the ground-level, neural-level explanation for why a certain professor of cognitive science once chose to reshelve a certain book on the brain, or once refrained from swatting a certain fly, or once broke out in giggles during a solemn ceremony, or once exclaimed, lamenting the departure of a cherished coworker, Shell be hard shoes to fill!
This is why it is much more natural for us to say that a war was triggered for religious or economic reasons than to try to imagine a war as a vast pattern of interacting elementary particles and to think of what triggered it in similar terms  even though physicists may insist that that is the only true level of explanation for it, in the sense that no information would be thrown away if we were to speak at that level.
I have to emphasize that theres no extra physical (or extra-physical) force here; the local, myopic laws of physics take care of everything on their own, but the global arrangement of the dominos is what determines what happens, and if you notice (and understand) that arrangement, then an insight-giving shortcut to the answer of the non-falling domino in the divisor stretch (as well as the falling domino in the prime stretch) is served to you on a silver platter.
The simms are still there, to be sure, but they are simply serving the simmballs dance, allowing it to happen, with the microdetails of their bashings being no more relevant to the ongoing process of cognition than the microdetails of the bashings of air molecules are relevant to the turning of the blades of a windmill.
(In my childhood, the power of exponentials was more innocently but no less indelibly imprinted on me by the story of a sultan who commanded that on each square of a chessboard there be placed twice as many grains of rice as on the previous square  and after less than half the board was full, it was clear there was not nearly enough rice in the sultanate or even the whole world to get anywhere close to the end.)
Years later, when I took my children to Holland and we visited the park called Madurodam (those quote marks, by the way, are a testimony to the lifelong effect on me of Nagel and Newmans insistence on the importance of distinguishing between use and mention), which contains dozens of beautifully constructed miniature replicas of famous buildings from all over Holland, I was most disappointed to see that there was no miniature replica of Madurodam itself, containing, of course, a yet tinier replica, and so on I was particularly surprised that this lacuna existed in Holland, of all places  not only the native land of M. C. Escher, but also the home of Drostes famous hot chocolate, whose box, much like the Mortons Salt box, implicated itself in an infinite regress, something that all Dutch people grow up knowing very well.
One of the most vehement objectors was a professor of education at the University of Delaware, who quoted the famous behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner on the topic of selfreferring sentences: Perhaps there is no harm in playing with sentences in this way or in analyzing the kinds of transformations which do or do not make sentences acceptable to the ordinary reader, but it is still a waste of time, particularly when the sentences thus generated could not have been emitted as verbal behavior.
If I slowly panned the camera leftwards, thus towards the center of the screen and perforce further down the apparent corridor, more and more doorways would come into view along the right wall, smaller and smaller and farther and farther away  and all of a sudden, at a critical moment, there was a wonderful, dizzying sense of infinity as I would find myself peering all the way down the corridor toward a gaping emptiness, stretching arbitrarily far away toward a single point of convergence (the vanishing point, as it is called in the theory of perspective).
In short, there are surprising new structures that looping gives rise to that constitute a new level of reality that could in principle be deduced from the basic loop and its detailed properties, but that in practice have a different kind of life of their own and that demand  at least when it comes to extremely finite, simplicity-seeking, pattern-loving creatures like us  a new vocabulary and a new level of description that transcend the basic level out of which they emerge.
Indeed, to some people  perhaps to most, perhaps even to us all  the ineffable sense of being an I or a first person, the intuitive sense of being there or simply existing, the powerful sense of having experience and of having raw sensations (what some philosophers refer to as qualia), seem to be the realest things in their lives, and an insistent inner voice bridles furiously at any proposal that all this might be an illusion, or merely the outcome of some kind of physical processes taking place among third-person (i.e., inanimate) objects.
Thus, to give a hopefully amusing example, myriads of microscopic olfactory twitchings in the nostrils of a voyager walking down an airport concourse can lead, depending on the voyagers state of hunger and past experiences, to a joint triggering of the two symbols sweet and smell, or a triggering of the symbols gooey and fattening, or of the symbols Cinnabon and nearby, or of the symbols wafting, advertising, subliminal, sly, and gimmick  or perhaps a triggering of all eleven of these symbols in the brain, in some sequence or other.
There is something that feels remarkably like a marble, and that fact is crucial to my portraying and to your grasping of the situation, just as the concepts of corridor, galaxy, and black hole were crucial in allowing me to perceive and describe the phenomena on the screen of the self-watching television  even if, strictly speaking, no corridor, no galaxy, and no black hole were there to be seen.
Where the Buck Seems to Stop I have recounted the story of the half-real, half-unreal marble inside the box of envelopes to suggest a metaphor for the type of reality that applies to our undeniable feeling that something solid or real resides at the core of ourselves, a powerful feeling that makes the pronoun I indispensable and central to our existence.
If one understands the careenium well, it would seem that both points of view are valid, although the latter one, leaving out no details, might seem to be the more fundamental one (we could call it the Gods eye point of view), while the former, being a highly compressed simplification in which vast amounts of information are thrown away, might seem to be the more useful one for us mortals, as it is so much more efficient (even though some things then seem to happen for no reason  thats the tradeoff ).
The image of the organic growth of an infinite structure or pattern, all springing out of a finite set of initial seeds, struck Gdel as much more than a mere curiosity; in fact, it reminded him of the fact that theorems in PM (like theorems in Euclids Elements) always spring (by formal rules of inference) from earlier theorems in PM, with the exception of the first few theorems, which are declared by fiat to be theorems, and thus are called axioms (analogues to the seeds).
Miraculous Lockstep Synchrony The conceptual parallel between recursively defined sequences of integers and the leapfrogging set of theorems of PM (or, for that matter, of any formal system whatever, as long as it had axioms acting as seeds and rules of inference acting as growth mechanisms) suggested to Gdel that the typographical patterns of symbols on the pages of Principia Mathematica  that is, the rigorous logical derivations of new theorems from previous ones  could somehow be mirrored in an exact manner inside the world of numbers.
If you have a very short recipe for calculating a very long formulas Gdel number, then instead of describing that huge number in the most plodding, clunky way (the successor of the successor of the successor of  the successor of the successor of zero), you can describe it via your computational shortcut, and if you express your shortcut in symbols (rather than inserting the numeral itself) inside the formula, then you can make the formula talk about itself without squeezing an elephant into a matchbox.
In fact, the picketing Posh Shop worker named Cagey, who disgustedly proclaims, after a brash matron pushes her aside and arrogantly strides into Alf and Berties upscale showroom, Anyone who crosses the picket line in front of Alf and Berties Posh Shop is scum, was inevitably heard by everyone in the audience (which by definition consisted solely of people who had crossed the picket line outside the theater) as saying, Anyone who crossed the picket line in front of this theater is scum, and of course this amounted to saying, Anyone who is now sitting in this audience is scum, which could also be heard as You should not be listening to these lines, which was the diametric opposite of what all the actors, including the one playing the part of Cagey, wanted to tell their audience, whose entry into the theater they so much appreciated, given the ushers hostile picket line.
The preconception that an obviously suspicion-arousing word such as this (or I or here or now  indexicals, as they are called by philosophers  words that refer explicitly to the speaker or to something closely connected with the speaker or the message itself) is an indispensable ingredient for self-reference to arise in a system is shown by Gdels discovery to be a nave illusion; instead, the strange twisting-back is a simple, natural consequence of an unexpected isomorphism between two different situations (that which is being talked about, on the one hand, and that which is doing the talking, on the other).
It cropped up because Principia Mathematica is in essence about the natural numbers, and what Gdel saw was that the world of natural numbers is so rich that, given any pattern involving objects of any type, a set of numbers can be found that will be isomorphic to it  in other words, there are numbers that will perfectly mirror the objects and their pattern, numbers that will dance in just the way the objects in the pattern dance.
But suppose that through a stunning stroke of genius you discovered a new kind of Gdel ray (i.e., some clever new Gdel numbering, including all of the standard Gdel machinery that makes prim numbers dance in perfect synchrony with provable strings) that allowed you to see through to a hidden second level of meaning belonging to Imp  a hidden meaning that proclaimed, to those lucky few who knew how to decipher it, The integer i is not prim, where i happened to be the Gdel number of Imp itself.
We are consequently fated to describe what goes on about us, including what other people do and what we ourselves do, not in terms of the underlying particle physics (which lies many orders of magnitude removed from our everyday perceptions and our familiar categories), but in terms of such abstract and ill-defined high-level patterns as mothers and fathers, friends and lovers, grocery stores and checkout stands, soap operas and beer commercials, crackpots and geniuses, religions and stereotypes, comedies and tragedies, obsessions and phobias, and of course beliefs and desires, hopes and fears, dreads and dreams, ambitions and jealousies, devotions and hatreds, and so many other abstract patterns that are a million metaphorical miles from the microworld of physical causality.
It entails taking into account all the particles in all the members of the hogs family, all the particles in the barn it lives in, in the mud it wallows in, in the farmer who feeds it, in the atmosphere it breathes, in the raindrops that fall on it, in the cumulo-nimbus clouds from which those drops fall, in the thunderclaps that make the hogs eardrums reverberate, in the whole of the earth, in the whole of the sun, in the cosmic background radiation pervading the entire universe and stretching back in time to the Big Bang, and on and on.
CHAPTER 13 The Elusive Apple of My I The Patterns that Constitute Experience BY OUR deepest nature, we humans float in a world of familiar and comfortable but quite impossible-to-define abstract patterns, such as: fast food and clamato juice, tackiness and wackiness, Christmas bonuses and customer service departments, wild goose chases and loose cannons, crackpots and feet of clay, slam dunks and bottom lines, lip service and elbow grease, dirty tricks and doggie bags, solo recitals and sleazeballs, sour grapes and soap operas, feedback and fair play, goals and lies, dreads and dreams, she and he  and last but not least, you and I.
My list is a random walk through an everyday kind of mental space, drawn up in order to give a feel for the phenomena in which we place the most stock and in which we most profoundly believe (sour grapes and wild goose chases being quite real to most of us), as opposed to the forbidding and inaccessible level of quarks and gluons, or the only slightly more accessible level of genes and ribosomes and transfer RNA  levels of reality to which we may pay lip service but which very few of us ever think about or talk about.
There are, I concede, a few exceptions, such as our modern keen awareness of the microscopic causes of disease, and also our interest in the tiny spermegg events that give rise to a new life, and the common knowledge of the role of microscopic factors in the determination of the sex of a child  but these are highly exceptional.
It is our unlimitedly extensible human category system that underwrites this fantastic jump in sophistication from other animals to us, in that it allows each of us to build up our episodic memory  the gigantic warehouse of our recollections of events, minor and major, simple and complex, that have happened to us (and to our friends and family members and people in books and films and newspaper articles and so forth, ad infinitum) over a span of decades.
), gives rise to the endless hall of mirrors that constitutes my I. I Cannot Live without My Self Since we perceive not particles interacting but macroscopic patterns in which certain things push other things around with a blurry causality, and since the Grand Pusher in and of our bodies is our I, and since our bodies push the rest of the world around, we are left with no choice but to conclude that the I is where the causality buck stops.
Horney is obviously not speaking of ones awareness of ones most superficial perceptual features such as height or hair color, or of ones knowledge of slight abstractions such as what kind of job one has and whether one enjoys it, but rather of the (inevitably somewhat distorted) image that one forms, over a lifetime, of ones own deepest character traits, of ones level in all sorts of blurry social hierarchies, of ones greatest accomplishments and failures, of ones fulfilled and unfulfilled yearnings, and on and on.
At the same time as I myself was getting ever more used to the fact that this I thing was responsible for what I did, my parents and friends were also becoming more convinced that there was indeed something very realseeming in there (in other words, something very marblelike, something with its unique brands of hardness and resilience and shape), which merited being called you or he or Douggie, and that also merited being called I by Douggie  and so once again, the sense of reality of this I was being reinforced over and over again, in myriad ways.
In order to get across the meaning of soap digest rack in detail, you would have to explain, for starters, the notions of electricity and electromagnetic waves, of TV cameras and transmitters and TV sets, of TV shows and advertising, the notion of washing machines and rivalries between detergent companies, the idea of daily episodes of predictable hackneyed melodramas broadcast into the homes of millions of people, the image of viewers addicted to endlessly circling plots, the concept of a grocery store, of a checkout stand, of magazines, of display racks, and on and on Each of the words soap, digest, and rack would wind up being expanded into a chain of ancient Sanskrit words thousands of times longer than itself.
The only hope for either the Alfbert or the Kldgerot is to notice that certain patterns are used over and over again in the sea of symbols, and to give these patterns names, thus compressing the string into something more manageable, and then carrying this process of patternfinding and compression out at the new, shorter level, and each time compressing further and further and further until finally the whole string collapses down into just one simple idea: I am not edible (or, translating out of the allegory, I am not provable).
Your typical human brain, being blissfully ignorant of its minute physical components and their arcanely mathematizable mode of microscopic functioning, and thriving instead at the infinitely remote level of soap operas, spring sales, super skivaganzas, SUVs, SATs, SOBs, Santa Claus, splashtacular scuba specials, snorkels, snowballs, sex scandals (and lets not forget sleazeballs), makes up as plausible a story as it can about its own nature, in which the starring role, rather than being played by the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cerebellum, or any other weirdly named and gooey physical structure, is played instead by an anatomically invisible, murky thing called I, aided and abetted by other shadowy players known as ideas, thoughts, memories, beliefs, hopes, fears intentions, desires, love, hate, rivalry, jealousy, empathy, honesty, and on and on  and in the soft, ethereal, neurology-free world of these players, your typical human brain perceives its very own I as a pusher and a mover, never entertaining for a moment the idea that its star player might merely be a useful shorthand standing for a myriad of infinitesimal entities and the invisible chemical transactions taking place among them, by the billions  nay, the millions of billions  every single second.
This, our innate blindness to the world of the tiny, forces us to hallucinate a profound schism between the goal-lacking material world of balls and sticks and sounds and lights, on the one hand, and a goalpervaded abstract world of hopes and beliefs and joys and fears, on the other, in which radically different sorts of causality seem to reign.
And they also interact with the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise advance in evolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary scene yet, including the emergence of the living cell.
The customer with the black-and-white tabloid Weekly World News in his cart, the odd look of the cashier as she picks it up and reads the headline about the baby found, perfectly healthy, floating in a life raft from the Titanic, the embarrassed chuckle of the customer, the quip by the next person in line, and so on.
We would carry the plates into the kitchen and then stand together at the sink, washing, rinsing, and drying, going over the whole evening together to the extent that we could replay it in our joint mind, laughing with delight at the spontaneous wit and re-savoring the unexpected interactions, commenting on who seemed happy and who seemed glum  and what was most striking in these post partyum decompressions was that the two of us almost always agreed with each other down the line.
Also being a believer in the thesis that external memory is a very real part of our personal memories, I think that an infinitesimal sliver of Carols consciousness resides even in the slips of paper on which I captured some of her cleverer bon mots, and a somewhat larger (though still tiny) shard of her resides in the yellow lined notebooks in which I have, in the past few months of grieving, recorded so many of our joint experiences.
And of course, in addition to a photo of someone and the set of someones complete works, there are so many other cases of elaborate patterns that contain fragments of souls  imagine, for example, having many hours of videotapes of Bach playing the organ and talking about his music, or of James Clerk Maxwell talking about physics and describing the moment when he discovered that light must be an electromagnetic wave, or of Pushkin reciting his own poetry, or of Galileo telling about how he discovered the moons of Jupiter, or of Jane Austen explaining how she imagined her characters and their complex intrigues Just where comes the point of critical mass, when having a pattern, perhaps a large set of videotapes, perhaps an extensive diary (like Anne Franks), amounts to having a significant percentage of the person  a significant percentage of their self, their soul, their I, their consciousness, their interiority?
If you concede that a significant percentage of the person would exist at some point along this spectrum, provided that one had a sufficiently large pattern, then it seems to me that you would have to concede that even having a much smaller pattern, such as a photo or my cherished collection of Carols bonner mots, already gives you a non-zero (even if microscopic) fraction of the actual person  of the view from inside  not just of how it was to be with them.
On a skiing vacation in the Sierra Nevada, far away from home, my children and I took advantage of the doggie cam at the Bloomington kennel where we had boarded our golden retriever Ollie, and thanks to the World Wide Web, we were treated to a jerky sequence of stills of a couple of dozen dogs meandering haphazardly in a fenced-in play area outdoors, looking a bit like particles undergoing random Brownian motion, and although each pooch was rendered by a pretty small array of pixels, we could often recognize our Ollie by subtle features such as the angle of his tail.
For some reason, the kids and I found this act of visual eavesdropping on Ollie quite hilarious, and although we could easily describe this droll scene to our human friends, and although I would bet a considerable sum that these few lines of text have vividly evoked in your mind both the canine scene at the kennel and the human scene at the ski resort, we all realized that there was not a hope in hell that we could ever explain to Ollie himself that we had been spying on him from thousands of miles away.
If you seriously believe, as I do and have been asserting for most of this book, that concepts are active symbols in a brain, and if furthermore you seriously believe that people, no less than objects, are represented by symbols in the brain (in other words, that each person that one knows is internally mirrored by a concept, albeit a very complicated one, in ones brain), and if lastly you seriously believe that a self is also a concept, just an even more complicated one (namely, an I, a personal gemma, a rock-solid marble), then it is a necessary and unavoidable consequence of this set of beliefs that your brain is inhabited to varying extents by other Is, other souls, the extent of each one depending on the degree to which you faithfully represent, and resonate with, the individual in question.
In contrast to the caged-bird metaphor, the idea I am proposing here is that since a normal adult human brain is a representationally universal machine, and since humans are social beings, an adult brain is the locus not only of one strange loop constituting the identity of the primary person associated with that brain, but of many strange-loop patterns that are coarse-grained copies of the primary strange loops housed in other brains.
is a mansion in the English countryside, a team of horses pulling a carriage down a country lane, an elegantly clad lady and gentleman sitting side by side in the carriage exchanging pleasantries when they espy a poor old woman emerging from her humble cottage along the roadside We are so taken in by what we see that in some important and serious sense we dont notice the room we are sitting in, the trees visible through its window, nor even the black smudges speckled all over the white rectangles in our hands (even though, paradoxically, we are depending on those smudges to bring us the visual images I just described).
Theres no claim that the act of copying is simultaneous or perfect or total  just that each person lives partially in the brain of the other, and that if the bandwidth were turned up more and more and more and still more, they would come to live more and more inside each other  until, in the limit, the sense of a clear boundary between them would slowly be dissolved, as it is for the two halves of a Twinwirld pairson (and even more so for a Siamese Twinwirld pairson).
My point, though, is that the myth of watertight boundaries between souls is something whose falsity we all have slight tastes of all the time, but since it is so convenient and so conventional to associate one body with precisely one soul, since it is so deeply tempting and so deeply ingrained to see a body and a soul as being in perfect alignment, we choose to downplay or totally ignore the implications of the everyday manifestations of the interpenetration of souls.
It seems to me, therefore, that the instinctive although seldom articulated purpose of holding a funeral or memorial service is to reunite the people most intimate with the deceased, and to collectively rekindle in them all, for one last time, the special living flame that represents the essence of that beloved person, profiting directly or indirectly from the presence of one another, feeling the shared presence of that person in the brains that remain, and thus solidifying to the maximal extent possible those secondary personal gemmae that remain aflicker in all these different brains.
Its not the swinging of a chain, the plopping of a stone in a pond, the splashing of a waterfall, the swirling of a hurricane, the refilling of a flush toilet, the self-regulation of the temperature in a house, the flow of electrons in a program that plays chess, the wiggling of an ovum-seeking sperm, the neural firings in a hungry mosquitos brain but we are getting ever closer as this list progresses.
Part of what makes my experience of a purple flower so intense is all the subtle shades I see on each petal, the delicate way each petal is curved, and the way the petals all swirl together around a glowing center made of dozens of tiny dots SL #641: Not to mention the way the flower is poised on a branch, and the branch is part of a bush, and the bush is just one of many in a brightly colored garden SL #642: Are you intimating that I dont enjoy the purple for its own sake, but only because of the way its embedded in a vast scene?
Whereas we bought right into the teleportation equals travel theme of Episode I, falling for it hook, line, and sinker, we seem in Episode II to have unthinkingly taken the path of least resistance, which runs something like this: If there are two different things that look like, think like, and quack like Derek Parfit, and if one of those things is located where we last saw Parfit and the other one of them is farther away, then, by God, the close one is obviously the real one, and the far one is just a copy  a clone, a counterfeit, an impostor, a fake.
In this scenario, shortly after the destruction of the original Parfit body and brain, two brand-new Parfits (both complete with shaving nick) would be assembled more or less simultaneously on the two planets, and now there really doesnt seem to be any valid claim of primacy for either one above the other (unless you argue that the first one finished should get to claim the honor of the Cartesian Ego, but in that case, we can simply posit that they are assembled in synchrony, thus barring that easy escape route).
I say its closer to that answer rather than saying that it is that answer, because Parfits view, like mine in this book, is that these things that seem so black-and white to us actually come in shades of gray  its just that in ordinary circumstances, things are always so close to being pure black or white that any hints of grayness remain hidden from view, not only thanks to the obvious external fact that we all have separate physical brains housed in separate skulls, but also thanks to an extensive web of linguistic and cultural conventions that collectively and subliminally insist that we each are exactly one person (this is the caged-bird metaphor of Chapter 18, and its also the Cartesian Ego notion), and which implicitly discourage us from imagining any kind of blending, overlapping, or sharing of souls.
The Radical Nature of Parfits Views To dismantle unconscious beliefs that are so deeply rooted and that have such a degree of primacy in our worldview is an extremely daunting and bold undertaking, comparable in subtlety and difficulty to what Einstein accomplished in creating special relativity (undermining, through sheer logic, our deepest and most unquestioned intuitions about the nature of time), and what a whole generation of brilliant physicists, with Einstein at their core, collectively accomplished in creating quantum mechanics (undermining our deepest and most unquestioned intuitions about the nature of causality and continuity).
Dave is a very insightful thinker, and he is every bit as aware as I am of the seeming craziness of his distinction between Universes Q and Z, between Machines Q and Z, and between himself and his alleged zombie twin, but whereas I find all of this unacceptably silly, Dave is convinced that, outrageous though such a distinction seems at first to be, Universe Qs mysterious, nonphysical, and causality-lacking extra ingredient lan mental  a close kin to the notion of feelium discussed by Strange Loops #641 and #642  is the missing key to the otherwise inexplicable nature of consciousness.
Somebody else drank that last soft drink in the refrigerator; the formerly all-night grocery store now closes at midnight; my friends car has a flat tire; the dog ate my homework; the plane just pulled out of the gate thirty seconds ago; the flight has been canceled because of a snowstorm in Saskatoon; were having computer troubles and we cant seem to make PowerPoint work in here; I left my wallet in my other pair of pants; you misread the final deadline; the reviewer was someone who hates us; she didnt hear about the job until too late; the runner in the next lane is faster than I am; and so on and so forth.
I was naturally filled with gratification when the popularity of my book Gdel, Escher, Bach linked my name in some fashion in the musical community with that of Bach (this was a true honor), and in Bachs 300th birthyear, 1985, I had the pleasure of participating in several tricentennial celebrations, including a tiny one on his exact birthday that I organized in Ann Arbor for the members of a class I was teaching, plus a few friends, the highlight of which was the small firestorm unleashed when we lit all 300 candles on the giant birthday cake I had ordered.
Of course there is room in this world for many ways to perform any work of music, and of course there was something interesting about these singers speed and slickness, and the way that they executed ultrarapid trills flawlessly  it was impressive in much the same way as the engineering details of a beautiful sports car are impressive  but for me it had nothing to do with the meaning of the music.
Though neither Carol nor I was religious in the least, there was something that to me rang so true in this nave image of her purest essence leaving her mortal remains and soaring up, up, forever up, even if, in the end, it was not into the sky that her soul was flying, but merely into this guy As this story reveals, this guy, for all his years of scientific training and hardheaded thinking about mind and spirit as rooted in physics, is at times susceptible to the traditional dualistic imagery with which most of us are brought up  if not by our families, then by our wider culture.
