Besides the electrical engineering theory of the trans mission of messages, there is a larger field which in cludes not only the study of language but the study of messages as a means of controlling machinery and society, the development of computing machines and other such automata, certain reflections upon psychol ogy and the nervous system, and a tentative new theory of scientific method.
The process of receiving and of using information is the process of THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS our adjusting to the contingencies of the outer environ ment, and of our living effectively within that environ ment.
Toward the middle of the last century, the work of Clerk Maxwell and of his precursor, Faraday, had at tracted the attention of physicists once more to optics, the science of light, which was now regarded as a form of electricity that could be reduced to the mechanics of a curious, rigid, but invisible medium known as the ether, which, at the time, was supposed to permeate the atmosphere, interstellar space and all transparent materials.
The steps between the actuation of a machine of this type by sense organs and its performance of a task may be as simple as in the case of the electric door; or it may be in fact of any desired degree of complexity within the limits of our engineering tech niques.
The determination of the mode of conduct of these machines is given through a special sort of input, which frequently consists of punched cards or tapes or of magnetized wires, and which determines the way in which the machine is go ing to act in one operation, as distinct from the way in which it might have acted in another.
We have seen in this chapter the fundamental unity of a complex of ideas which until recently had not been sufficiently associated with one another, namely, the contingent view of physics that Gibbs introduced as a modification of the traditional, Newtonian con ventions, the Augustinian attitude toward order and conduct which is demanded by this view, and the theory of the message among men, machines, and in society as a sequence of events in time which, though it itself has a certain contingency, strives to hold back nature's tendency toward disorder by adjusting its parts to various purposive ends.
The result is that the temperature goes up at one end and down at the other thus creating a p erpetual motion of "the second kind" : that is, a perpetual motion which does not violate the first law of thermodynamics, which tells us that the amount of energy within a given system is constant, but does violate the second law of thermodynamics, which tells us that energy spontaneously runs down hill in tem perature.
If these two turnstiles are connected by a passageway with a treadmill in it, the fast-moving people will have a greater tendency to turn the treadmill in one direc tion than the slow people to turn it in the other, and we shall gather a source of useful energy in the fortuitous milling around of the crowd.
This is one of the fundamental facts of biology; and in par ticular of the theory of photosynthesis, or of the chem ical process by which a plant is enabled to use the sun's rays to form starch, and other complicated chemicals necessary for life, out of the water and the carbon dioxide of the air.
Thus the question of whether to interpret the second law of thermodynamics pessimistically or not depends on the importance we give to the universe at large, on the one hand, and to the islands of locally decreasing entropy which we find in it, on the other.
To those of us who are aware of the extremely limited range of physical conditions under which the chemical reactions necessary to life as we know it can take place, it is a foregone conclusion that the lucky accident which permits the continuation of life in any form on this earth, even without restricting life to something like human life, is bound to come to a complete and disastrous end.
Factually, it asserts that the earlier advance of geographical discovery, whose inception corresponds to the beginning of modern times, is to be continued / THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS into an indefinite period of invention, of the discovery of new techniques for controlling the human environ ment.
The Hebrew prophets are far from cheerful in their evaluation of the future of mankind, or even of their chosen Israel; and the great morality play of Job, while it grants him a victory of the spirit, and while the Lord deigns to return to him his Hocks and his servants and his wives, nevertheless gives no assurance that such a 1 CYBERNETICS AND SOCIETY relatively happy outcome will take place except through the arbitrariness of God.
Under these circumstances, there is no use in looking anywhere in earlier history for parallels to the success- CYBERNETICS AND SOCIETY ful inventions of the steam engine, the steamboat, the locomotive, the modern smelting of metals, the tele graph, the transoceanic cable, the introduction of elec tric power, dynamite and the modern high explosive missile, the airplane, the electric valve, and the atomic bomb.
In the age of discovery Europe had become aware for the first time of the existence of great thinly-settled areas capable of taking up a population exceeding that of Europe itself; a land full of unexplored resources, not only of gold and silver but of the other commodities of commerce as well.
Not only do messages go out controlling the motion of the tow locomotives, the opening and closing of the sluices, and the opening and closing of the gates; but the control room is full of telltales which indicate not merely that the locomotives, the sluices, and the gates have received their orders, but that they have in fact effectively carried out these orders.
It is a thesis of this chapter that this aspiration of the fascist for a human state based on the model of the ant results from a profound misapprehension b oth of the nature of the ant and of the nature of man.
Both the insect and the man are air-breathing forms, and represent the end of a long transition from the easygoing life of the water borne animal to the much more exacting demands of the land-bound.
In view of the impossibility of a large stored mem ory, as well as of the fact that the youth of an insect such as an ant is spent in a form which is insulated from the adult phase by the intermediate catastrophe of metamorphosis, there is no opportunity for the ant to learn much.
Be that as it may, while the problem of the conduc tion of impulses along a fiber may be described in a rather simple way as an all-or-none phenomenon, the problem of the transmission of an impulse across a layer of synaptic connections depends on a complicated pat tern of responses, in which certain combinations of in coming fibers, firing within a certain limited time, will cause the message to go further, while certain other combinations will not.
This view of the nervous system corresponds to the theory of those machines that consist in a sequence of switching devices in which the opening of a later switch depends on the action of precise combinations of earlier switches leading into it, which open at the same time.
Add this to the preju: dices of the physiologist in favor of all-or-none action, and we see why the greater part of the work which has been done on the mechanical simulacra of the brain has been on machines which are more or less on a dig ital basis.
It is, of course, possible that the relation between the line and the terminal machine is so perfect that the amount of information contained in a message, from the point of view of the carrying capacity of the line, and the amount of information of the fulfilled orders, measured from the point of view of the operation of the machine, will be identical with the amount of in fonnation transmitted over the compound system con sisting of the line followed by the machine.
The types of abstractions belong ing to the important semantic stage are not merely those associated with built-in permanent subassem blies of neurons in the brain, such as those which must play a large role in the perception of geometrical form; but with abstraction-detector-apparatus consisting of parts of the internuncial pool-that is, of sets of neurons which are available for larger assemblies, but are not permanently locked into them-which have been tem porarily assembled for the purpose.
Actually this is true in the case of every human being other than the particular person to whom any given passage is addressed in each particular case; in the sense that that person can have access to the in ternal thoughts of another person only through the actions of the latter.
As my father was a very heretical philologist whose influence tended to lead philology in much the same direction as the modern influences of communication theory, I wish to continue this chapter with a few THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS amateurish reflections on the history of language and the history of our theory of language.
Accordingly, the Bible of the Christians and the Jews, the sacred books of the Persians and the Hindus, the Buddhist scriptures, the writings of Confucius, all have their early commenta tors.
At the beginning of the last century the work of the brothers Grimm and of the Dane, Rask, showed not only that the Teutonic languages came within the or bit of this so-called Indo-European group, but went further to make clear the linguistic relations of these languages to one another, and to a supposed distant common parent.
During the Middle Ages Latin of a varying quality, the best of it quite acceptable to anyone but a pedant, remained the universal language of the clergy and of all learned men throughout Western Europe, even as Arabic has remained in the Moslem world down to the CYBERNETICS AND SOCIETY present day.
This continued prestige of Latin was made possIble by the willingness of writers and speakers of the language either to borrow from other languages, or to construct within the frame of Latin itself, all that was necessary for the discussion of the live philosoph ical problems of the age.
In the hands of the great Italian scholars of the Renaissance, this reformed Latin could be, and often was, a work of art; but the training necessary to wield such a delicate and refined tool was beyond that which would be incidental to the training of the scientist, whose main work must always concern itself with content rather than with perfection of form.
May I remark that all we possess of Aristotle is what amounts to the school notebooks of his disciples, written in one of the most crabbed technical jargons in the history of the world, and totally unintelligible to any contemporary Greek who had not been through the discipline of the Lyceum?
The impor tant thing is that the Greek language of the time of Aristotle was ready to compromise with the technical jargon of a brilliant scholar, while even the English of CYBERNETICS AND SOCIETY his learned and reverend successors is not willing to compromise with the similar needs of modern speech.
With these admonitory words, let us return to a mod ern point of view which assimilates the operation of linguistic translation and the related operations of the interpretation of language by ear and by brain to the performance and the coupling of non-human commu nication networks.
The inventions of the telephone, the tele graph, and other similar means of communication have shown that this capacity is not intrinsically restricted to the immediate presence of the individual, for we have many means to carry this tool of communication to the ends of the earth.
With the airplane and the radio the word of the rulers extends to the ends of the earth, and very many of the factors which previously precluded a World State have been abrogated.
It is amusing as well as instructive to consider what would happen if we were to transmit the whole pattern of the human body, of the human brain with its memories and cross connec tions, so that a hypothetical receiving instrument could re-embody these messages in appropriate matter, ca pable of continuing the processes already in the body and the mind, and of maintaining the integrity needed for this continuation by a process of homeostasis.
In short, the bodily trans mission of the architect and his documents may be replaced very effectively by the message-transmission of communications which do not entail the moving of a particle of matter from one end of the line to the other.
Thus the early miscroscopists were under the very natural temptation to regard the spermatozoon as the only important ele ment in the development of the young, and to ignore entirely the possibility of the as yet unobserved phe nomenon of fertilization.
It will be well to reconsider Kipling's test of the importance of traffic in the modern world from the point of view of a traffic which is overwhelmingly not so much the transmission of human bodies as the transmission of human information.
These mean: the liberty of each human being to develop in his freedom the full TIIE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS measure of the human possibilities embodied in him; the equality by which what is just for A and B remains just when the positions of A and B are interchanged; and a good will between man and man that knows no limits short of those of humanity itself.
If it is unam biguously clear what each task and each payment is to be, and if one of the parties does not invoke methods of imposing his will on the other party which are for eign to the contract itself, then the determination of whether the bargain is equitable may safely be left to the judgment of the two contracting parties.
The judges, those to whom is confided the task of the interpretation of the law, should perform their function in such a spirit that if Judge A is replaced by Judge B , the exchange cannot be expected t o make a material change in the court's interpretation of customs and of 1 08 TIlE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS statutes.
From the very early times of the colonies, the Indians had neither the bulk of population nor the equality of arms to meet the whites on a fair basis, especially when the so-called land trea ties between the whites and the Indians were being n e gotiated.
Law seems to consider punishment, now as a threat to discourage other possible criminals, now as a ritual act of expiation on the part of the guilty man, now as a device for removing him from society and for protecting the latter from the danger of repeated misconduct, and noW as an agency for the social and the moral reform of the b ig t : l ) r l 1 10 TIlE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS individual.
On the other hand, under the impetus of Senator McCarthy and his imitators, the blind and excessive classification of military information, and the recent attacks on the State Department, we are approaching a secretive frame of mind paralleled in history only in the Venice of the Renaissance.
It is perhaps worth while to point out that it does not represent a universal basis of human values : that it corresponds neither to the doctrine of the Church, which seeks for the salvation of the human soul, nor to that of Marxism, which values a society for its reali zation of certain specific ideals of human well-being.
The first, Dickens glorifies as the common sense craftsman, with the broad thumb of the hand worker, and the honesty of the man who is always facing facts ; whereas the Mudfog Association is nothing but a derogatory alias for the British Association for the Advancement of Science in its early days.
Whether a further allow ance is made for the faon or not depends on many factors, such as the persistence of the seller, the style in favor when it was made, the purely artistic crafts manship, the historical value of the piece for museum purposes, and the resistance of the buyer.
The stamp market, the rare book market, the market for Sandwich glass and for Duncan Phyfe furniture are all artificial, in the sense that in addition to the real pleasure which the posses sion of such an object gives to its owner, much of the value of the fac;on pertains not only to the rarity of the object itself, but to the momentary existence of an ac tive group of buyers competing for it.
While the hearer gains some thing very important in the appreciation of a musical composition if he is physically present at the perform ance, nevertheless his preparation for an understand ing of this performance will be so greatly enhanced by hearing good records of the composition that it is hard to say which of the two is the larger experience.
In deed, he goes further, and considers that information which has been developed in the laboratories of his own country is morally the property of that country; and that the use of this information by other national ities not only may be the result of treason, but intrinsi cally partakes of the nature of theft.
England was the first country to go through a full-scale industrial revolution; and from this early age it inherited the nar row gauge of its railways, the heavy investment of its cotton mills in obsolete equipment, and the limitations of its social system, which have made the cumulative needs of the present day into an overwhelming emer gency, only to be met by what amounts to a social and industrial revolution.
However, when a number of passages are enciphered in a type of cipher which is common to the whole set, even though the detailed encipher ment varies, there may be enough in common between the different passages to lead to a breaking, first of the general type of cipher, and then of the particular ci phers used.
Take a prob lem of this importance and assure the scientific world that it has an answer; then both the intellectual ability of the scientists and the existing laboratory facilities are so widely distributed that the quasi-independent realization of the task will be a matter of merely a few years anywhere in the world.
For example, the concentrated effort of Oak Ridge and Los Alamos in time of war has made the question of the protection of the people of the United States, not only from the possible enemies em ploying an atomic bomb, but from the atomic radia tion of our new industry, a thing which concerns us now.
What is true in the limited war of the court is also true in the war to the death of in ternational relations, whether it takes the bloody form of shooting, or the suaver form of diplomacy.
Thus the earlier stages of creative work, whether in the arts or in the sciences, which should properly be governed by a great desire on the part of the students to create something and to communicate it to the world at large, are now subject instead to the formal requirements of finding Ph.D. theses or similar apprentice media.
Yet every day we meet with examples of painting where, for instance, the artist has bound himself from the new canons of the abstract, and has displayed no intention to use these canons to display an interesting and novel form of beauty, to pursue the uphill fight against the prevailing tendency toward the commonplace and the banal.
What sometimes enrages me and always disappoints and grieves me is the prefer ence of great schools of learning for the derivative as opposed to the original, for the conventional and thin which can be duplicated in many copies rather than the new and powerful, and for arid correctness and limitation of scope and method rather than for universal newness and beauty, wherever it may be seen.
More over, I protest, not only as I have already done against the cutting off of intellectual originality by the diffi culties of the means of communication in the modern world, but even more against the ax which has been put to the root of originality because the people who have elected communication as a career so often have nothing more to communicate.
The other was the construction of good mathematical tables of the motion of the moon, which enabled the navigator to use that body as the clock with which to check the apparent motion of the sun.
Accordingly, the advance guard of the craftsmen of the industrial revolution consisted on the one hand of clockmakers, who used the new mathematics of New ton in the design of their pendulums and their balance wheels; and on the other hand, of optical-instrument makers, with their sextants and their telescopes.
It is clearly impossible in construct in g a great turret lathe to depend on the unaided hu man hand for the pouring of the metal, for the placing of the castings on the instruments to machine them, and above all for the power needed in the task of machining them.
There was an exploitation of the labor of children and women to an extent, and of a brutality scarcely conceivable at the present time-that is, if we forget the South African diamond mines and ignore the new industrialization of China and India and the general terms of plantation labor in almost every country.
By this, I mean that a great many of the disastrous conse quences and phases of the earlier part of the industrial revolution were not so much due to any moral obtuse ness or iniquity on the part of those concerned, as to certain technical features which were inherent in the ,early means of industrialization, and which the later THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS history of technical development has thrust more or ', less into the background.
The design of machines involving such parts has been transferred from the domain of the skilled shopworker to that of the research-laboratory man; and in this he has all the available tools of circuit theory to replace a mechanical ingenuity of the old sort.
There were sporadic uses of the vacuum tube and of its sister invention, the photoelectric cell, for scan ning the products of industry; as for example, for regulating the thickness of a web coming out of a paper machine, or for inspecting the color of a can of pine- 1 48 THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS apples.
In partial differential equation, the quantities which the place of the time are spread out in space, and suggested to Bush that in view of the technique of vision scanning which was then developing at speed, we would, ourselves, have to consider such , technique to represent the many variables of, let us space, against the one variable of time.
The consequent development of tomatization, both before and after the publication of the first edition of this book, has convinced m e that I ' was right in my judgment and that this development would be one of the great factors in conditioning the: social and technical life of the age to corne, the keynote ' of the second industrial revolution.
In its potential significance, the vacuum tube certainly belongs to an industrial revolution different from that of the age of power; and yet it is only at present that the true sig nificance of the invention of the vacuum tube has been sufficiently realized to allow us to attribute the present age to a new and second industrial revolution.
It may be thought that the present great expense of computing machines bars them from use in industrial processes; and furthermore that the delicacy of the work needed in their construction and the variability of their functions precludes the use of the methods of mass production in constructing them.
On the one hand, it receives its detailed instruc tions from elements of the nature of sense organs, such as photoelectric cells, condensers for the reading of the thickness of a web of paper, thermometers, hydrogen ion-concentration meters, and the general run of ap paratus now built by instrument companies for the manual control of industrial processes.
The farm laborer too, although he is beginning to be pressed by automatic machinery, is protected from the full pres sure of it because of the ground he has to cover, the variability of the crops he must till, and the special conditions of weather and the like that he must meet.
Just as the emergency of the Battle of Britain made it necessary to attack the radar problem in a massive manner, and to hurry up the natural development of the field by what may have been decades, so too, the needs of labor replacement are likely to act on us in a similar way in the case of another war.
We shall see a process parallel to the way in which the use of atomic energy for bombs has been allowed to compromise the very necessary potentialities of the long-time use of atomic power to replace our oil and coal supplies, which are within cen- THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS turies, if not decades, of utter exhaustion.
Since the publication of the first edition of this book, I have participated in two big meetings with representatives of business manage ment, and I have been delighted to see that awareness on the part of a great many of those present of the social dangers of our new technology and the social obligations of those responsible for management to see that the new modalities are used for the benefit of man, for increasing his leisure and enriching his spiritual life, rather than merely for profits and the worship of the machine as a new brazen calf.
There is thus a feedback dependent on the source of THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS light proceeding from the light to the photoelectric cells, and thence to the rudder control system, by which it finally regulates the direction of its own motion and changes the angle of incidence of the light.
The help of the machine may extend to the construction of better artificial limbs; to instru ments to help the blind to read pages of ordinary text by translating the visual pattern into auditory terms; and to other similar aids to make them aware of ap proaching dangers and to give them freedom of locomo tion.
Aids of this last class are probably the eas iest to construct; partly because the technique of the telephone is the best studied and most familiar tech nique of communication; partly because the depriva tion of hearing is overwhelmingly a deprivation of one thing-free participation in human conversation; and partly because the useful information carried by speech can be compressed into such a narrow compass that it is not beyond the carrying-power of the sense of touch.
The first stage consists in the acoustic symbols taken physically as vibrations in the air; the second or phonetic stage consists in the various phenomena in the inner ear and the associated part of the nervous system; the third or semantic stage represents the transfer of these symbols into an experience of meaning.
Other uses of hearing are important, such as the reception of 1 70 THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS the sounds of nature and the appreciation of music, but they are not so important that we should consider a person as socially deaf if he shared in the ordinary, in terpersonal communication by speech, and in no other use of hearing.
Can't one imagine a machine to collect this or that type of information, as for example information on production and the market; and then to determine as a function of the average psychology of human beings, and of the quantities which it is possible to measure in a determined instance, what the most probable development of the situation might be?
For outside of the very serious problems which the volume of information to be collected and to be treated rapidly THE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS still put, the problems of the stability of prediction re main beyond what we can seriously dream of controlling.
The variation of the rules depends both on the effective detail of the situa tions engendered by the game itself, and on the system of psychological reactions of the players in the face of the results obtained at each instant.
These are, on the one hand, a sufficient ignorance on the part of the mass of the players exploited by a skilled player, who moreover may plan a method of paralyzing the consciousness of the masses; or on the other, suffi cient good-will to allow one, for the sake of the stability of the game, to refer his decisions to one or a few players of the game who have arbitrary privileges.
In particular, much of the work, although not all, which we have done on the theory of games, is based on the assumption that both we and our oppo nents have unlimited capabilities and that the only restrictions within which we play depend on what we may call the cards dealt to us or the visible positions on the chess board.
A sort of machine a gouverner is thus now essentially in operation on both sides of the world con flict, although it does not consist in either case of a single machine which makes policy, but rather of a mechanistic technique which is adapted to the xigen cies of a machine-like group of men devoted to the formation of policy.
In the strict von Neumann theory of games this means that the speaker and listener co operate on policy in view of the assumption that the jamming agency is adopting the best policy to confuse them, again under the assumption that the speaker and the listener have been using the best policy up to the present, and so on.
In more usual language, both the team of communi cants and the jamming forces are at liberty to use the technique of bluffing to confound one another, and in general this technique will be used to prevent the other TIIE HUMAN USE OF HUMAN BEINGS side from being able to act on a firm knowledge of the technique of one side.
Its inability to undertake an a ggressive policy, deliberately to de feat the scientist, means that its evil doing is the result of a weakness in his nature rather than of a specifically evil power that it may have, equal or inferior to the principles of order in the universe which, local and temporary as they may be, still are probably not too unlike what the religious man means by God.
The emotional difficulty of Augustinianism shows itself in Milton's dilemma in Paradise Lost: If the devil is merely the creature of God and belongs to a world in which God is omnipotent, serving to point out some of the dark, confusing corners of the world, the great battle between the fallen angels and the forces of the Lord becomes about as interesting as a professional wres tling match.
For all we know, the world from the next moment on might be something like the croquet game in Alice in Woruler land, where the balls are hedgehogs which walk off, the hoops are soldiers who march to other parts of the field, and the rules of the game are made from instant to instant by the arbitrary decree of the Queen.
