The good-to-great examples that made the final cut into the study attained extraordinary results, averaging cumulative stock returns 6.9 times the general market in the fifteen years following their transition points.2 To put that in perspective, General Electric (considered by many to be the best-led company in America at the end of the twentieth century) outperformed the market by 2.8 times over the fifteen years 1985 to 2000.3 Furthermore, if you invested $1 in a mutual fund of the good-togreat companies in 1965, holding each company at the general market rate until the date of transition, and simultaneously invested $1 in a general market stock fund, your $1 in the good-to-great fund taken out on January 1, 2000, would have multiplied 471 times, compared to a 56 fold increase in the market.4 These are remarkable numbers, made all the more remarkable when you consider the fact that they came from companies that had previously been so utterly unremarkable.
Every good-to-great company embraced what we came to call the Stockdale Paradox: You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND a t the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.
Two attacks came as hostile takeover bids from Revlon, led by Ronald Perelman, a cigar-chomping raider with a reputation for breaking apart companies to pay down junk bonds and finance more hostile raids.15 The third attack came from Coniston Partners, an investment group that bought 5.9 percent of Gillette stock and initiated a proxy battle to seize control of the board, hoping to sell the company to the highest bidder and pocket a quick gain on their shared6 Had Gillette been flipped to Perelman at the price he offered, shareowners would have reaped an instantaneous 44 percent gain on their stock."
Had the takeover been successful, these projects would almost certainly have been curtailed or eliminated, and none of us would be shaving with Sensor, Sensor for Women, or the Mach3-leaving hundreds of millions of people to a more painful daily battle with stubble.I9 Second, at the time of the takeover battle, Sensor promised significant future profits that were not reflected in the stock price because it was in secret development.
If a shareflipper had accepted the 44 percent price premium offered by Ronald Perelman on October 31, 1986, and then invested the full amount in the general market for ten years, through the end of 1996, he would have come out three times worse off than a shareholder who had stayed with Mockler and Gillette.20Indeed, the company, its customers, and the shareholders would have been ill served had Mockler capitulated to the raiders, pocketed his millions, and retired to a life of leisure.
~ ~ Chrysler experienced a brief return to glory in the five years after Iacocca's retirement, but the company's underlying weaknesses eventually led to a buyout by German carmaker D a i m l e r - B e n ~Certainly, .~~ the demise of Chrysler as a stand-alone company does not rest entirely on Iacocca's shoulders (the next generation of management made the fateful decision to sell the company to the Germans), but the fact remains: Iacocca s brilliant turnaround in the early 1980s did not prove to be sustained and Chrysler failed to become an enduring great company.
If you didn't have the capacity to become the best executive in the industry in your span of responsibility, then you would lose your paycheck.39 Such rigorous rebuilding might be expected from an outsider brought in to turn the company around, but Cain was an eighteen-year veteran insider and a family member, the son of a previous Abbott president.
The opening paragraph reads: "I was a very lucky guy from the very beginning of my life: marvelous parents, good genes, lucky in love, lucky in business, and lucky when a Yale classmate had my orders changed to report to Washington, D.C., in early 1941, instead of to a ship that was sunk with all hands lost in the North Atlantic, luck y to be in the Navy, and lucky to be alive at e i g h t y f i ~ e .

Iverson saw the first, second, and third problems facing the American steel industry not to be imports, but managernent5* He even went so far as to speak out publicly against government protection against imports, telling a stunned gathering of fellow steel executives in 1977 that the real problems facing the American steel industry lay in the fact that management had failed to keep pace with inn~vation.~~ The emphasis on luck turns out to be part of a pattern that we came to call the window and the mirror.
Wells Fargo began its fifteen-year stint of spectacular performance in 1983, but the foundation for the shift dates back to the early 1970s, when then-CEO Dick Cooley began building one of the most talented management teams in the industry (the best .~ foresaw that the team, according to investor Warren B ~ f f e t t ) Cooley banking industry would eventually undergo wrenching change, but he did not pretend to know what form that change would take.
At a time when its sector of the banking industry fell 59 percent behind the general stock market, Wells Fargo outperformed the market by over three times.4 Carl Reichardt, who became C E O in 1983, attributed the bank's success largely to the people around him, most of whom he inherited from Cooley.5As he listed members of the Wells Fargo executive team that had joined the company during the Cooley-Reichardt era, we were stunned.
Nearly every person had gone on to become C E O of a major company: Good to Great Bill Aldinger became the C E O of Household Finance, Jack Grundhofer became C E O of U.S. Bancorp, Frank Newman became C E O of Bankers Trust, Richard Rosenberg became C E O of Bank of America, Bob Joss became C E O of Westpac Banking (one of the largest banks in Australia) and later became dean of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University-not exactly your garden variety executive team!
Arjay Miller, an active Wells Fargo board member for seventeen years, told us that the Wells Fargo team reminded him of the famed "Whiz Kids" recruited to Ford Motor Company in the late 1940s (of which Miller was a member, eventually becoming president of Ford).6Wells Fargo's approach was simple: You get the best people, you build them into the best managers in the industry, and you accept the fact that some of them will be recruited to become CEOs of other companies.'
"9 A retired Bank of America executive described senior managers in the 1970s as "Plastic People" who'd been trained to quietly submit to the dictates of a domineering CEO.1 Later, after losing over $1 billion in the mid1980s, Bank of America recruited a gang of strong generals to turn the bank around.
He left and went back to where he came from.14In all, fourteen of twenty-six executives left the company, replaced by some of the best, smartest, and hardest-working executives in the entire world of finance.I5 The same standard applied up and down the Fannie Mae ranks as managers at every level increased the caliber of their teams and put immense peer pressure upon each other, creating high turnover at first, when some people just didn't pan out.16"We had a saying, 'You can't fake it at Fannie Mae,' " said one executive team member.
Through acquisitions, Singleton built the company from a small enterprise to number 293 on the Fortune 500 list in six years.22Within ten years, he'd completed more than 100 acquisitions, eventually creating a far-flung enterprise with 130 profit centers in everything from exotic metals to insurance.23Amazingly, the whole system worked, with Singleton Jim Collins TELEDYNE CORPORATION A Classic "Genius with a Thousand Helpers" Ratio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market, January 1, 1967 -January 1, 1996 End of Singleton Era Rise under a Genius, Henry Singleton himself acting as the glue that connected all the moving parts together.
But it built its pay system around a high-pressure team-bonus mechanism, with over 50 percent of a Good to Great worker's compensation tied directly to the productivity of his work team of twenty to forty people.29Nucor team members would usually show up for work thirty minutes early to arrange their tools and prepare to blast off the starting line the instant the shift gun fired.30"We have the hardest working steel workers in the world," said one Nucor executive.
Crocker people had long been steeped in the traditions and perks of old-style banker culture, complete with a marbled executive dining room with its own chef and $500,000 worth of china.j5 Quite a contrast to the spartan culture at Wells Fargo, where management ate food prepared by a college dormitory food service.36Wells Fargo made it clear to the Crocker managers: "Look, this is not a merger of equals; it's an acquisition; we bought your branches and your customers; we didn't acquire you."
7743 One of the key contrasts between Alan Wurtzel at Circuit City and Sidney Cooper at Silo is that Wurtzel spent the bulk of his time in the early years focused on getting the right people on the bus, whereas Cooper spent 80 percent of his time focusing on the right stores to Wurtzel's first goal was to build the best, most professional management team in the industry; Cooper's first goal was simply to grow as fast as possible.
Circuit City put tremendous emphasis on getting the right people all up and down the line, from delivery drivers to vice presidents; Silo developed a reputation for not being able to do the basics, like making home deliveries without damaging the products.45 According to Circuit City's Dan Rexinger, "We made the best home delivery drivers in the industry.
He talked with pride and excitement about the transformation of Kimberly-Clark, how it had the guts to sell the paper mills, how it had the foresight to exit the paper business and throw the proceeds into the consumer business, and how it had taken on Procter & Gamble.
C H U R C H I L L , The Hinge of Fate1 n the early 1950s, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, commonly known as A&P, stood as the largest retailing organization in the world and one of the largest corporations in the United States, at one point ranking behind only General Motors in annual sales.2 Kroger, in contrast, stood as an unspectacular grocery chain, less than half the size of A&P, with performance that barely kept pace with the general market.
Now, right off the bat, you might be thinking: "Okay, so the story of A&P is one of an aging company that had a strategy that was right for the times, but the times changed and the world passed it by as younger, betterattuned companies gave customers more of what they wanted.
In 1958, Forbes magazine described A&P as "the Hermit Kingdom," run as an absolute monarchy by an aging prince.3 Ralph Burger, the successor to the Hartford brothers who had built the A&P dynasty, sought to preserve two things above all else: cash dividends for the family foundation and the past glory of the Hartford brothers.
By the early 1990s, Kroger had rebuilt its entire system on the new model and was well on the way to becoming the number one grocery chain in America, a position it would attain in 1999.13Meanwhile, A&P still had over half its stores in the old 1950s size and had dwindled to a sad remnant of a once-great American institution.14 FACTS ARE BETTER THAN D R E A M S One of the dominant themes from our research is that breakthrough results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated one on top of another.
Both companies held near-monopoly market positions with virtually the same customer basePitney Bowes in postage meters and Addressograph in address-duplicating machines-and both faced the imminent reality of losing their monopolies.15By 2000, however, Pitney Bowes had grown to over 30,000 employees and revenues in excess of $4 billion, compared to the sorry remnants of Addressograph, which had less than $100 million and only 670 employees.16 For the shareholder, Pitney Bowes outperformed Addressograph 3,581 to 1 (yes, three thousand five hundred and eighty-one times better).
According to Fortune, he sought to use Addressograph as a platform to reestablish his leadership prowess in the eyes of the world.17 Ash set forth a vision to dominate the likes of IBM, Xerox, and Kodak in the emerging field of office automation-a bold plan for a company that had previously only dominated the envelope-address-duplication business.18There is nothing wrong with a bold vision, but Ash became so wedded to his quixotic quest that, according to Business Week, he refused to confront the mounting evidence that his plan was doomed to fail and might take down the rest of the company with it.19 He insisted on milking cash from profitable arenas, eroding the core business while throwing money after a gambit that had little chance of success.20 Later, after Ash was thrown out of office and the company had filed for bankruptcy (from which it did later emerge), he still refused to confront reality, saying: "We lost some battles, but we were winning the war.
* UNWAVERING FAITH A M I D THE BRUTAL FACTS When Procter & Gamble invaded the paper-based consumer business in the late 1960s, Scott Paper (then the leader) simply resigned itself to second place without a fight and began looking for ways to diversify.46"The company had a meeting for analysts in 1971 that was one of the most depressing I've ever attended," said one analyst.
(Tap-tap equals the letter a, tap-pause-tap-tap equals the letter b, tap-tap-pause-tap equals the letter f; and so forth, for twenty-five letters, c doubling in for k.) At one point, during an imposed silence, the prisoners mopped and swept the central yard using the code, swish-swashing out "We love you" to Stockdale, on the third anniversary of his being shot down.

Putting aside their egos, the Wells Fargo team pulled the plug on the vast majority of its international operations, accepting the truth that it could not be better than Citicorp in global banking.13 Wells Fargo then turned its attention to what it could be the best in the world at: running a bank like a business, with a focus on the western United States.
Abbott eventually became the number one company in both of these arenas, which moved it far down the path of becoming the best company in the world at creating products that make health care more cost-effective.18 Upjohn never confronted the same brutal reality and continued to live with the delusion that it could beat Merck.19 Later, when it fell even further behind the pharmaceutical leaders, it diversified into arenas where it definitely could not be the best in the world, such as plastics and chemicals.
As Upjohn fell even further behind, it returned to a focus on ethical drugs, yet never confronted the fact that it was just too small to win in the big-stakes pharmaceutical gameS2ODespite consistently spending nearly twice the percentage of sales on R&D as Abbott, Upjohn saw its profits dwindle to less than half those of Abbott before being acquired in 1995.21 roo lim Collins Clearly, a Hedgehog Concept is not the same as a core competence.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the comparison companies' mindless pursuit of growth: Over two thirds of the comparison companies displayed an obsession with growth without the benefit of a Hedgehog Concept.31Statements such as "We've been a growth at any price company" and "Betting that size equals success ' pepper the materials on the comparison companies.
Most companies build their bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline, which then further drives the right people away, and so forth.
He froze executive salaries for two years (despite the fact that Wells Fargo was enjoying some of the most profitable years in its history).12He shut the executive dining room and replaced it with a college dorm food-service caterer.13He closed the executive elevator, sold the corporate jets, and banned green plants from the executive suite as too expensive to water.14 He removed free coffee from the executive suite.
They preserved their posh executive kingdom in its imposing tower in downtown Sam Francisco, the CEO's office described in the book Breaking the Bank as "a northeast corner suite with a large attached conference room, oriental rugs, and floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a sweeping panorama of the San Francisco Bay from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge.
After losing $1.8 billion across three years in the mid-1980s, B of A eventually made the necessary changes in response to deregulation (largely by hiring ex-Wells executive^).^^ But even in the darkest days, B ofA could not bring itself to get rid of the perks that shielded its executives from the real world.
Postal Service and its patents on postage meter machines, Pitney attained 100 percent of the metered mail market.39By the end of the 1950s, nearly half of all U.S. mail passed through Pitney Bowes machines.40With gross profit margins in excess of 80 percent, no competition, a huge market, and a recession-proof business, Pitney Bowes wasn't so much a great company as it was a company with a great monopoly.
For example, Pitney eventually attained 45 percent of the high-end fax market for large companies, a hugely profitable cash machine.43 Harvey began a systematic process of investment in new technologies and products, such as the Paragon mail processor that seals and sends letters, and by the late 1980s, Pitney consistently derived over half its revenues from products introduced in the previous three years.44 Later, Pitney Bowes became a pioneer at linking backroom machines to the Internet, yet another opportunity for disciplined diversification.
It was a wholly undisciplined acquisition that came about in part because Sea-Land's founder was a close friend of R. J. Reynolds' chairman.47 After pouring more than $2 billion into Sea-Land, the total investment nearly equaled the entire amount of net stockholders' equity.48 Finally, after years of starving the tobacco business to funnel funds into the sinking ship business, RJR acknowledged failure and sold S e a - L a n ~ lOne .~~ Reynolds grandson complained: "Look, these guys are the world's best at making and selling tobacco products, but what do they know about ships or oil?
It grew into a $3.5 billion Fortune 500 company with only four layers of management and a corporate headquarters staff of fewer than twenty-five people-executive, financial, secretarial, the whole shebang-crammed into a rented office the size of a small dental practice.52Cheap veneer furniture adorned the Good to Great distinctions and creating an egalitarian meritocracy that aligns management, labor, and financial interests Could become the best in the world at harnessing culture denominator of Nucor's THREE CIRCLES 1970-1 995 lobby, which itself was not much larger than a closet.
By the 1990s, Nucor's profitability beat Bethlehem's every single year, and at the end of the century, Nucor-which Good to Great had been less than a third the size of Bethlehem only a decade earlierfinally surpassed Bethlehem in total revenues.62Even more astounding, Nucor's average five-year profit per employee exceeded Bethlehem by almost ten times.63And for the investor, $1 invested in Nucor beat $1 invested in Bethlehem Steel by over 200 times.
If you have Level 5 leaders who get the right people on the bus, if you confront the brutal facts of reality, if you create a climate where the truth is heard, if you have a Council and work within the three circles, if you frame all decisions in the context of a crystalline Hedgehog Concept, if you act from understanding, not bravado-if you do all these things, then you are likely to be right on the big decisions.
The entrepreneur admitted to the Industry Standard that it seemed strange to go public before starting a business, but that didn't stop him from trying to persuade investors to buy 1.1 million shares at $7 to $9 per share, despite having no revenues, no employees, no customers, no company.j With the new technology of the Internet, who needs all those archaic relics of the old economy?
Wrote Forbes in October 1999: "Investors seem to think that the Web race will be won by competitors who hit the ground running- companies like drugstore.com, which trades at 398 times revenue, rather than Walgreen, trading at 1.4 times revenue.04 Analysts downgraded Walgreens' stock, and the pressure on Walgreens to react to the Internet threat increased as nearly $1 5 billion in market value evaporated5 Walgreens' response in the midst of this frenzy?
For example, to create the Sensor, Gillette invested over $200 million in design and development, most of it focused on manufacturing breakthroughs, and earned twenty-nine patents.13It pioneered the application of laser welding on a mass scale to shaving systems-a technology normally used for expensive and sophisticated products like heart pacemakers.14 The whole key to Gillette's shaving systems lay in manufacturing technology so unique and proprietary that Gillette protected it the way Coca-Cola protects its secret formula, complete with armed guards and security clearances.ls ]im Collins I T E C H N O L O G Y A C C E L E R A T O R S IN T H E 0- GREAT C Technology Accelerators Linked to Hedgehog Concept during Transition Era Abbott Pioneered application of computer technology to increase economic denominator of profit per employee.
To date, the system has saved home buyers nearly $4 billion.18 Notice that the Fannie Mae transition began in 1981, with the arrival of David Maxwell, yet the company lagged behind in the application of technology until the early 1990s.
Technology was a key part of what Fannie Mae leaders called "the second wind" of the transformation and acted as an accelerating factor.19The same pattern holds for Kroger, Gillette, Walgreens, and all the good-to-great companies- the pioneering application of technology usually came late in the transition and never at the start.
"~' In essence, the Time editors didn't pick the person of the century so much as they picked the theme of the century- technology and scienceand attached the most famous person to it.
Nucor, for example, became widely known as one of the most aggressive pioneers in the application of mini-mill steel manufacturing, with dozens of articles and two books that celebrated its bold investments in continuous thin slab casting and electric arc furnaces.22Nucor became a cornerstone case at business schools as an example of unseating the old order through the advanced application of new technologies.
In case after case, we found fewer articles in the decade leading up to the point of transition than in the decade after, by an average factor of nearly three times.4 Good to Great CIRCUIT CITY Cumulat~veValue of $1 Invested, Number of Art~clesFound December 31, 1972 - December 31, 1992 C~rcu~t city $31 I 64 $300 $200 $1 00 General Market $8 35 For example, Ken Iverson and Sam Siege1 began turning the Nucor flywheel in 1965.
People who say, "Hey, but we've got constraints that prevent us from taking this longerterm approach," should keep in mind that the good-to-great companies followed this model no matter how dire the short-term circumstancesderegulation in the case of Wells Fargo, looming bankruptc y in the cases of Nucor and Circuit City, potential takeover threats in the cases of Gillette and Kroger, or million-dollar-a-day losses in the case of Fannie Mae.
While the specific permutations of the doom loop varied from company to company, there were some highly prevalent patterns, two of which deserve particular note: the misguided use of acquisitions and the selection of leaders who undid the work of previous generations.
The Misguided U s e of Acquisitions Peter Drucker once observed that the drive for mergers and acquisitions comes less from sound reasoning and more from the fact that doing deals is a much more exciting way to spend your day than doing actual work.35 Indeed, the comparison companies would have well understood the popular bumper sticker from the 1980s, "When the going gets tough, we go shopping!"
To understand the role of acquisitions in the process of going from good to great, we undertook a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis of all acquisitions and divestitures in all the companies in our study, from ten years before the transition date through 1998.

Today, we take for granted that most air travel takes place on Boeing jets, but in 1952, almost no one outside the military flew on Boeing.16 Wisely, through the 1940s, Boeing had stayed away from the commercial sphere, an arena in which McDonnell Douglas had vastly superior abilities in the smaller, propeller-driven planes that composed the commercial fleet.17 In the early 1950s, however, Boeing saw an opportunity to leapfrog McDonnell Douglas by marrying its experience with large air- Good to Great What drives * Includes your core values and purpose , I !
So, in 1952, Bill Allen and his team made the decision to spend a quarter of the company's entire net worth to build a prototype jet that could be used for commercial aviation.18They built the 707 and launched Boeing on a bid to become the leading commercial aviation company in the world.
Three decades later, after producing five of the most successful commercial jets in history (the 707,727,737,747, and 757), Boeing stood as the absolute, unquestioned greatest company in the commercial airplane industry, worldwide.19 Not until the late 1990s would Boeing's number one position be seriously challenged, and it would take a government consortium in the form of Airbus to do it.20 rim Collins Here is the key point: Boeing's BHAG, while huge and daunting, was not any random goal.
Boeing's executives understood with calm, equanimity that (1) the company could become the best in the world at commercial jet manufacturing even though it had no presence in the market, (2) the shift would significantly improve Boeing's economics by increasing profit per aircraft model, and (3) the Boeing people were very passionate about the idea.
