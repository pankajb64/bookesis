All human beings  at least all sufficiently large-souled ones  have to make up their minds about such matters as the swatting of mosquitoes or flies, the setting of mousetraps, the eating of rabbits or lobsters or turkeys or pigs, perhaps even of dogs or horses, the purchase of mink stoles or ivory statues, the usage of leather suitcases or crocodile belts, even the penicillinbased attack on swarms of bacteria that have invaded their body, and on and on.
What has happened, however, is that a dynamic, snowballing entity has come into existence that over a period of years will be capable of developing a complex set of internal structures or patterns  and the presence, to a higher and higher degree, of those intricate patterns is what would endow that entity (or rather, the enormously more complex entities into which it slowly metamorphoses, step by step) with an ever-larger value along the Huneker soul-scale, homing in on a value somewhere in the vicinity of 100.
I would also argue that most peoples largely unconscious prejudices about whether to eat or not to eat this or that food, whether to buy or not to buy this or that article of clothing, whether to swat or not to swat this or that insect, whether to root or not to root for this or that species of robot in a sci-fi film, whether to be sad or not to be sad if a human character in a film or a novel meets with a violent end, whether to claim or not to claim that a particular senescent person is no longer there, and so forth, reflect precisely this kind of numerical continuum in their minds, whether they admit it or not.
You might wonder whether my having drawn a cone that impenitently depicts degrees of souledness during the development of a given human being implies that I would be more willing, if placed under enormous pressure (as in the film Sophies Choice), to extinguish the life of a two-year-old child than the life of a twenty-year-old adult.
Even though I sincerely believe there is much more of a soul in the twenty-year-old than in the two-year-old (a view that will no doubt dismay many readers), I nonetheless have enormous respect for the potential of the two-year-old to develop a much larger soul over the course of a dozen or so years.
In addition, I have been built, by the mechanisms of billions of years of evolution, to perceive in the two-year-old what, for lack of a better word, I will call cuteness, and the perceived presence of that quality grants the two-year-old an amazingly strong shell of protectedness against attacks not just by me, but by humans of all ages, sexes, and persuasions.
Most neuroscientists, if they were asked such a question, would make a list that would include (at least some of) the following items (listed roughly in order of physical size): amino acids neurotransmitters DNA and RNA synapses dendrites neurons Hebbian neural assemblies columns in the visual cortex area 19 of the visual cortex the entire visual cortex the left hemisphere Although these are all legitimate and important objects of neurological study, to me this list betrays a limited point of view.
Accordingly, I herewith propose a list of abstractions that researchers of the brain should be just as concerned with: the concept dog the associative link between the concepts dog and bark object files (as proposed by Anne Treisman) frames (as proposed by Marvin Minsky) memory organization packets (as proposed by Roger Schank) long-term memory and short-term memory episodic memory and melodic memory analogical bridges (as proposed by my own research group) mental spaces (as proposed by Gilles Fauconnier) memes (as proposed by Richard Dawkins) the ego, id, and superego (as proposed by Sigmund Freud) the grammar of ones native language sense of humor I I could extend this list arbitrarily.
In a ploy that, in my opinion, should fool only third-graders but that unfortunately takes in great multitudes of his professional colleagues, he pokes merciless fun at the idea that thinking could ever be implemented in a system made of such far-fetched physical substrates as toilet paper and pebbles (the tape would be an infinite roll of toilet paper, and a pebble on a square of paper would act as the dot in a cell), or Tinkertoys, or a vast assemblage of beer cans and ping-pong balls bashing together.
Was there truly something referable-to as I that was shoving around various physical brain structures, resulting in the sending of certain carefully coordinated messages through nerve fibers and the consequent moving of shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers in a certain complex pattern that left the book upright in its original spot  or, contrariwise, were there merely myriads of microscopic physical processes (quantummechanical collisions involving electrons, photons, gluons, quarks, and so forth) taking place in that localized region of the spatiotemporal continuum that poet Edson dubbed a teetering bulb?
Thinkodynamics and Statistical Mentalics It thus comes as no news to anyone that different levels of description have different kinds of utility, depending on the purpose and the context, and I have accordingly summarized my view of this simple truth as it applies to the world of thinking and the brain: Thinkodynamics is explained by statistical mentalics, as well as its flipped-around version: Statistical mentalics can be bypassed by talking at the level of thinkodynamics.
CHAPTER 3 The Causal Potency of Patterns The Prime Mover AS THE rest of this book depends on having a clear sense for the interrelationships between different levels of description of entities that think, I would like to introduce here a few concrete metaphors that have helped me a great deal in developing my intuitions on this elusive subject.
Of course this image is far-fetched, but remember that the careenium is merely intended as a useful metaphor for understanding our brains, and the fact is that our brains, too, are rather far-fetched, in the sense that they too contain tiny events (neuron firings) and larger events (patterns of neuron firings), and the latter presumably somehow have representational qualities, allowing us to register and also to remember things that happen outside of our crania.
Taking the Reductionistic View of the Careenium The first inclination of a modern physicist who heard this story might be reductionistic, in the sense of pooh-poohing the large simmballs as mere epiphenomena, meaning that although they are undeniably there, they are not essential to an understanding of the system, since they are composed of simms.
In my minds eye, I often see the simms as acting like the silver marbles in a pinball machine, with the simmballs acting like the pins  that is, the larger stationary cylindrical objects which the marbles strike and ricochet off of as they roll down the sloped board of play.
The Dance of the Simmballs From our higher-level macroscopic vantage point as we hover above the table, we can see ideas giving rise to other ideas, we can see one symbolic event reminding the system of another symbolic event, we can see elaborate patterns of simmballs coming together and forming even larger patterns that constitute analogies  in short, we can visually eavesdrop on the logic of a thinking mind taking place in the patterned dance of the simmballs.
Later, though, as we were driving home with our brand-new video camera, I reflected carefully on the matter, and I just couldnt see where in the world there would have been any danger to the system  either to the camera or to the TV  if I had closed the loop (though a priori either one of them would seem vulnerable to a meltdown).
Years later, when I took my children to Holland and we visited the park called Madurodam (those quote marks, by the way, are a testimony to the lifelong effect on me of Nagel and Newmans insistence on the importance of distinguishing between use and mention), which contains dozens of beautifully constructed miniature replicas of famous buildings from all over Holland, I was most disappointed to see that there was no miniature replica of Madurodam itself, containing, of course, a yet tinier replica, and so on I was particularly surprised that this lacuna existed in Holland, of all places  not only the native land of M. C. Escher, but also the home of Drostes famous hot chocolate, whose box, much like the Mortons Salt box, implicated itself in an infinite regress, something that all Dutch people grow up knowing very well.
Intellectuals Who Dread Feedback Loops Many years thereafter, when I was writing a monthly column called Metamagical Themas for Scientific American magazine, I devoted a couple of my pieces to the topic of self-reference in language, and in them I featured a cornucopia of sentences invented by myself, a few friends, and quite a few readers, including some remarkable and provocative flights of fancy, such as these: If the meanings of true and false were switched, this sentence wouldnt be false.
If I pointed the camera at the metal strip instead of the center of the screen, this gave me what looked like a snapshot of the right wall of a long corridor, showing a few evenly spaced doorways (which actually were images of that metal strip), moving away from where I was standing.
If I slowly panned the camera leftwards, thus towards the center of the screen and perforce further down the apparent corridor, more and more doorways would come into view along the right wall, smaller and smaller and farther and farther away  and all of a sudden, at a critical moment, there was a wonderful, dizzying sense of infinity as I would find myself peering all the way down the corridor toward a gaping emptiness, stretching arbitrarily far away toward a single point of convergence (the vanishing point, as it is called in the theory of perspective).
Of course each such interloping object opened up a whole new universe of possibilities, since we could vary its position as well as all the other standard variables (the amount of zoom, the angle of tilt, the direction of the camera, the brightness, the contrast, and others).
Another way of thinking about how real X is to you is how much you would trust a newspaper article that took for granted the existence of X (for example, a living dinosaur, a sighting of Hitler, insects discovered on Mars, a perpetual-motion machine, UFO abductions, Gods omniscience, out-ofbody experiences, alternate universes, superstrings, quarks, Bigfoot, Big Brother, the Big Bang, Atlantis, the gold in Fort Knox, the South Pole, cold fusion, Einsteins tongue, Holden Caulfields brain, Bill Gates checkbook, or the proverbial twenty-mile wall for marathon runners).
Our hangnails are incredibly real to us (by coincidence, I found myself idly picking at a hangnail while I was reworking this paragraph), whereas to most of us, the English village of Nether Wallop and the high Himalayan country of Bhutan, not to mention the slowly swirling spiral galaxy in Andromeda, are considerably less real, even though our intellectual selves might wish to insist that since the latter are much bigger and longer-lasting than our hangnails, they ought therefore to be far realer to us than our hangnails are.
To be sure, if one points the TV camera straight at the screen (or brings the microphone right up to the loudspeaker) one gets that strange feeling of playing with fire, not only by violating a natural-seeming hierarchy but also by seeming to create a true infinite regress  but when one thinks about it, one realizes that there was no ironclad hierarchy to begin with, and the suggested infinity is never reached; then the bubble just pops.
Mathematical reasoning seemed to have been precisely characterized as the repeated use of certain basic rules of logic, dubbed rules of inference, such as modus ponens: If you have proven a result X and you have also proven X  Y (where the arrow represents the concept of implication, so that the line means If X is true, then Y is also true), then you can toss Y into the bin of proven results.
The image of the organic growth of an infinite structure or pattern, all springing out of a finite set of initial seeds, struck Gdel as much more than a mere curiosity; in fact, it reminded him of the fact that theorems in PM (like theorems in Euclids Elements) always spring (by formal rules of inference) from earlier theorems in PM, with the exception of the first few theorems, which are declared by fiat to be theorems, and thus are called axioms (analogues to the seeds).
Gdel himself had great respect for the power of PM, as is shown by the opening sentences of his 1931 article: The development of mathematics in the direction of greater exactness has  as is well known  led to large tracts of it becoming formalized, so that proofs can be carried out according to a few mechanical rules.
Glimmerings of How PM Can Twist Around and See Itself Gdel saw that the game of building up an infinite class of numbers, such as wff numbers, through recursion  that is, making new members of the club by combining older, established members via some number-crunching rule  is essentially the same idea as Fibonaccis recursive game of building up the class of F numbers by taking sums of earlier members.
The distinction between members and non-members of the wff club is every bit as genuine a number-theoretical distinction as that between members and non-members of the club of squares, the club of prime numbers, or the club of F numbers, for wff numbers are definable in a recursive arithmetical (i.e., computational) fashion.
Prim Numbers Having realized that some hypothetical volume of the series by Whitehead and Russell could define and systematically explore the various numerical properties of wff numbers, Gdel pushed his analogy further and showed, with a good deal of fancy machinery but actually not very much conceptual difficulty, that there was an infinitely more interesting recursively defined class of whole numbers, which I shall here call prim numbers (whimsically saluting the title of the famous three tomes), and which are the numbers belonging to provable formulas of PM (i.e., theorems).
And then, making a move analogous to that of feeding Quines Quasi-Quip into itself (but in quotes), he took that formula fragments Gdel number k (which is a specific number, not a variable) and replaced the variable x by it, thus producing a formula (not just a fragment) that made a claim about a much larger integer, g. And g is the Gdel number of that very claim.
And you might also try to remember that the little number k is the Gdel number of a formula fragment containing a variable x, analogous to a subjectless sentence fragment in quote marks, while the larger number g is the Gdel number of a complete sentence in PM notation, analogous to a complete sentence in English.
In fact, the picketing Posh Shop worker named Cagey, who disgustedly proclaims, after a brash matron pushes her aside and arrogantly strides into Alf and Berties upscale showroom, Anyone who crosses the picket line in front of Alf and Berties Posh Shop is scum, was inevitably heard by everyone in the audience (which by definition consisted solely of people who had crossed the picket line outside the theater) as saying, Anyone who crossed the picket line in front of this theater is scum, and of course this amounted to saying, Anyone who is now sitting in this audience is scum, which could also be heard as You should not be listening to these lines, which was the diametric opposite of what all the actors, including the one playing the part of Cagey, wanted to tell their audience, whose entry into the theater they so much appreciated, given the ushers hostile picket line.
Nonetheless, when, nearly two decades later, this droll coincidence was revealed to the playgoing public in a wickedly witty review entitled On Formerly Unpennable Proclamations in Prince Hyppia: Math Dramatica and Related Stageplays (I), authored by the acerbic young Turko-Viennese drama critic Gerd Klot (Ill skip the details here, as the story is so well known), its piercing cogency was immediately appreciated by many, and as a result, playgoers who had read Klots irreverent review became able to rehear many of the famous lines uttered in Prince Hyppia: Math Dramatica as if they were not about numbers at all, despite what Y. Ted Enrustle had intended, but were direct (and often quite biting) comments about Y. Ted Enrustles play itself!
In the cases of both Prince Hyppia: Math Dramatica and Principia Mathematica, we saw that a system carefully designed to talk only about numbers and not to talk about itself nonetheless ineluctably winds up talking about itself in a cagey fashion  and it does so precisely because of the chameleonic nature of numbers, which are so rich and complex that numerical patterns have the flexibility to mirror any other kind of pattern.
Every bit as strange a loop, although perhaps a little less dramatic, would have been created if Gdel had concocted a self-affirming formula that cockily asserted of itself, This formula is provable via the rules of PM, which to me is reminiscent of the brashness of Muhammad (Im the greatest) Ali as well as of Salvador (The great) Dal.
The unanticipated meaning People in this audience are scum is, rather, the inevitable outcome of a blatantly obvious analogy (or mapping) between two entirely different picket lines (one outside the theater, one on stage), and thus, by extension, between the picketcrossing members of the audience and the picket-line crossers in the play they are watching.
Just as it is no miracle that a video system can create a selfreferential loop, but rather a kind of obvious triviality due to the power of TV cameras (or, to put it more precisely, the immensely rich representational power of very large arrays of pixels), so too it is no miracle that Principia Mathematica (or any other comparable system) contains self-focused sentences like Gdels formula, for the system of integers, exactly like a TV camera (only more so!
But suppose that through a stunning stroke of genius you discovered a new kind of Gdel ray (i.e., some clever new Gdel numbering, including all of the standard Gdel machinery that makes prim numbers dance in perfect synchrony with provable strings) that allowed you to see through to a hidden second level of meaning belonging to Imp  a hidden meaning that proclaimed, to those lucky few who knew how to decipher it, The integer i is not prim, where i happened to be the Gdel number of Imp itself.
By contrast, in the case of a creature that thinks with a brain (or with a careenium), reading its own brain activity at a high level is natural and trivial (for instance, I remember how terrified I was that time when Grandma took me to see The Wizard of Oz), whereas the low-level activities that underwrite the high level (numberless neurotransmitters hopping like crazy across synaptic gaps, or simms silently bashing by the billions into each other) are utterly hidden, unsuspected, invisible.
My list is a random walk through an everyday kind of mental space, drawn up in order to give a feel for the phenomena in which we place the most stock and in which we most profoundly believe (sour grapes and wild goose chases being quite real to most of us), as opposed to the forbidding and inaccessible level of quarks and gluons, or the only slightly more accessible level of genes and ribosomes and transfer RNA  levels of reality to which we may pay lip service but which very few of us ever think about or talk about.
Our perceptions and actions focus on far larger, vaguer things, and our deepest beliefs, far from being in electrons, are in the many macroscopic items that we are continually assigning to our high-frequency and low-frequency mental categories (such as fast food and doggie bags on the one hand, and feet of clay and customer service departments on the other), and also in the perceived causality, however blurry and unreliable it may be, that seems to hold among these large and vague items.
(thanks to the incredibly spartan symbol repertoire of a mosquito brain, barely larger than the symbol repertoire of a flush toilet or a thermostat), and accordingly, I have no qualms about dismissing the idea of there being a strange loop of selfhood in as tiny and swattable a brain as that of a mosquito.
In order to get across the meaning of soap digest rack in detail, you would have to explain, for starters, the notions of electricity and electromagnetic waves, of TV cameras and transmitters and TV sets, of TV shows and advertising, the notion of washing machines and rivalries between detergent companies, the idea of daily episodes of predictable hackneyed melodramas broadcast into the homes of millions of people, the image of viewers addicted to endlessly circling plots, the concept of a grocery store, of a checkout stand, of magazines, of display racks, and on and on Each of the words soap, digest, and rack would wind up being expanded into a chain of ancient Sanskrit words thousands of times longer than itself.
Your typical human brain, being blissfully ignorant of its minute physical components and their arcanely mathematizable mode of microscopic functioning, and thriving instead at the infinitely remote level of soap operas, spring sales, super skivaganzas, SUVs, SATs, SOBs, Santa Claus, splashtacular scuba specials, snorkels, snowballs, sex scandals (and lets not forget sleazeballs), makes up as plausible a story as it can about its own nature, in which the starring role, rather than being played by the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cerebellum, or any other weirdly named and gooey physical structure, is played instead by an anatomically invisible, murky thing called I, aided and abetted by other shadowy players known as ideas, thoughts, memories, beliefs, hopes, fears intentions, desires, love, hate, rivalry, jealousy, empathy, honesty, and on and on  and in the soft, ethereal, neurology-free world of these players, your typical human brain perceives its very own I as a pusher and a mover, never entertaining for a moment the idea that its star player might merely be a useful shorthand standing for a myriad of infinitesimal entities and the invisible chemical transactions taking place among them, by the billions  nay, the millions of billions  every single second.
If one points a TV camera at the middle of a blank screen, and if the camera sees only the screen and none of its frame, then despite its loopiness, all that this setup will produce, whether the camera stands still, tilts, turns, or zooms in and out (always without reaching the screens edge), is a fixed white image.
If, however, the camera turns far enough left or right, or zooms out far enough to take in something external to the blank screen (even just the tiniest patch of color), a bit of the screen will turn non-blank, and then, instantly, that non-blank patch will get sucked into the video loop and cycled around and around, like a tree limb picked up by a tornado.
Baby Feedback Loops and Baby I s Although I just conjured up the notion of a vanilla strange loop in a human brain, I certainly did not mean to suggest that a human baby is already at birth endowed with such a bare strange loop of selfhood  that is, a fully-realized, though vanilla, shell of pure, distilled I-ness  thanks to the mere fact of having human genes.
The last thing I want to remind you of before we go on to a new paragraph is that now loop A, although its still called just A, nonetheless involves loop B as well (and vice versa); each of these two loops now plays a role in defining the other one, though loop A plays a larger role in its own definition than does loop B (and vice versa).
(To be sure, the nested image of screen A on screen B will tilt or grow, all the way down the line of ever-more-nested images  but the orientation and size of the top-level screen in system B will remain unchanged, while those of the top-level screen in system A will be directly affected by what camera A does.)
Desperate Lark In the surreal months following the tragedy of Carols sudden death, I found myself ceaselessly haunted by the mystery of the vanishing of her consciousness, which made no sense at all to me, and by the undeniable fact that I kept on thinking of her in the present, which also confused me.
Also being a believer in the thesis that external memory is a very real part of our personal memories, I think that an infinitesimal sliver of Carols consciousness resides even in the slips of paper on which I captured some of her cleverer bon mots, and a somewhat larger (though still tiny) shard of her resides in the yellow lined notebooks in which I have, in the past few months of grieving, recorded so many of our joint experiences.
And of course, in addition to a photo of someone and the set of someones complete works, there are so many other cases of elaborate patterns that contain fragments of souls  imagine, for example, having many hours of videotapes of Bach playing the organ and talking about his music, or of James Clerk Maxwell talking about physics and describing the moment when he discovered that light must be an electromagnetic wave, or of Pushkin reciting his own poetry, or of Galileo telling about how he discovered the moons of Jupiter, or of Jane Austen explaining how she imagined her characters and their complex intrigues Just where comes the point of critical mass, when having a pattern, perhaps a large set of videotapes, perhaps an extensive diary (like Anne Franks), amounts to having a significant percentage of the person  a significant percentage of their self, their soul, their I, their consciousness, their interiority?
If you concede that a significant percentage of the person would exist at some point along this spectrum, provided that one had a sufficiently large pattern, then it seems to me that you would have to concede that even having a much smaller pattern, such as a photo or my cherished collection of Carols bonner mots, already gives you a non-zero (even if microscopic) fraction of the actual person  of the view from inside  not just of how it was to be with them.
For a while, ones speaking is largely fake  that is, one is thinking in ones native language but substituting words quickly enough to give the impression that the thinking is going on in the second language; however, as ones experience with the second language grows, new grammatical habits form and turn slowly into reflexes, as do thousands of lexical items, and the second language becomes more and more rooted, more and more genuine.
On a skiing vacation in the Sierra Nevada, far away from home, my children and I took advantage of the doggie cam at the Bloomington kennel where we had boarded our golden retriever Ollie, and thanks to the World Wide Web, we were treated to a jerky sequence of stills of a couple of dozen dogs meandering haphazardly in a fenced-in play area outdoors, looking a bit like particles undergoing random Brownian motion, and although each pooch was rendered by a pretty small array of pixels, we could often recognize our Ollie by subtle features such as the angle of his tail.
I remember admiring and then copying one friends uneven, jagged handwriting, a jaunty classmates cool style of blustering, an older boys swaggering walk, the way the French ticketseller in the film Around the World in Eighty Days pronounced the word amricain, a college friends habit of always saying the name of his interlocutor at the end of every phone call, and so forth.
Theres no claim that the act of copying is simultaneous or perfect or total  just that each person lives partially in the brain of the other, and that if the bandwidth were turned up more and more and more and still more, they would come to live more and more inside each other  until, in the limit, the sense of a clear boundary between them would slowly be dissolved, as it is for the two halves of a Twinwirld pairson (and even more so for a Siamese Twinwirld pairson).
The geographical place is merely the traditional breeding grounds for an ancient set of genes and memes  complexions, body types, hair colors, traditions, words, proverbs, dances, myths, costumes, recipes, and so forth  and as long as a critical mass of carriers of these genes and memes, located abroad, survives the cataclysm, all of this richness can continue to exist and flourish elsewhere, and the now-gone physical place can continue to be celebrated in song and story.
I say its closer to that answer rather than saying that it is that answer, because Parfits view, like mine in this book, is that these things that seem so black-and white to us actually come in shades of gray  its just that in ordinary circumstances, things are always so close to being pure black or white that any hints of grayness remain hidden from view, not only thanks to the obvious external fact that we all have separate physical brains housed in separate skulls, but also thanks to an extensive web of linguistic and cultural conventions that collectively and subliminally insist that we each are exactly one person (this is the caged-bird metaphor of Chapter 18, and its also the Cartesian Ego notion), and which implicitly discourage us from imagining any kind of blending, overlapping, or sharing of souls.
The Radical Nature of Parfits Views To dismantle unconscious beliefs that are so deeply rooted and that have such a degree of primacy in our worldview is an extremely daunting and bold undertaking, comparable in subtlety and difficulty to what Einstein accomplished in creating special relativity (undermining, through sheer logic, our deepest and most unquestioned intuitions about the nature of time), and what a whole generation of brilliant physicists, with Einstein at their core, collectively accomplished in creating quantum mechanics (undermining our deepest and most unquestioned intuitions about the nature of causality and continuity).
And so most people are put into the awkward position of having to say that there would be a particular spot along the wire at which all of a sudden, without warning, at the instant when the slider passes it, the Cartesian Ego of Parfit would poof out of existence, to be replaced by that of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Fancy 100-hunekerand-higher racecar brains like yours and mine have a lot of self-perception and hence a lot of consciousness, while very primitive wind-up rubber-band brains like those of mosquitoes have essentially none of it, and lastly, middle-level brains, with just a handful of hunekers (like that of a two-year-old, or a pet cat or dog) come with a modicum of it.
This may merely be a lexical gap or a confusing semantic blur in these languages (the meaning on a literal level is co-knowledge), but even if thats the case, I nonetheless think of it as offering us an insight that might otherwise never occur to us: that the partial internalization of other creatures interiority (conscience) is what most clearly marks off creatures who have large souls (much consciousness) from creatures that have small souls, and from yet others that have none or next to none.
Every time I found a new set of preludes and fugues from either volume, the act of putting the needle down in the grooves of the new record and listening to it for the first time was among the most exciting events in my life.
I was naturally filled with gratification when the popularity of my book Gdel, Escher, Bach linked my name in some fashion in the musical community with that of Bach (this was a true honor), and in Bachs 300th birthyear, 1985, I had the pleasure of participating in several tricentennial celebrations, including a tiny one on his exact birthday that I organized in Ann Arbor for the members of a class I was teaching, plus a few friends, the highlight of which was the small firestorm unleashed when we lit all 300 candles on the giant birthday cake I had ordered.
