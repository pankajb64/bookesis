ONE While I Was Sleeping Your Highnesses, as Catholic Christians, and princes who love and promote the holy Christian faith, and are enemies of the doctrine of Mahomet, and of all idolatry and heresy, determined to send me, Christopher Columbus, to the above-mentioned countries of India, to see the said princes, people, and territo ries, and to learn their disposition and the proper method of converting them to our holy faith; and furthermore directed that I should not proceed by land to the East, as is customary, but by a Westerly route, in which direction we have hith erto no certain evidence that anyone has gone.
Columbus sailed with the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria in an effort to discover a shorter, more di rect route to India by heading west, across the Atlantic, on what he pre sumed to be an open sea route to the East Indies rather than going south and east around Africa, as Portuguese explorers of his day were try ing to do.
Here I was in Bangaloremore than five hundred years after Columbus sailed over the horizon, using the rudimentary navigational technologies of his day, and returned safely to prove definitively that the world was roundand one of India's smartest engineers, trained at his country's top technical institute and backed by the most modern tech nologies of his day, was essentially telling me that the world was flatas flat as that screen on which he can host a meeting of his whole global supply chain.
But I was also excited personally, because what the flattening of the world means is that we are now connecting all the knowledge centers on the planet together into a single global network, whichif politics and terrorism do not get in the waycould usher in an amazing era of prosperity, innovation, and collaboration, by companies, communities, and individuals.
In the first half of this era, global integration was powered by falling trans portation costs, thanks to the steam engine and the railroad, and in the second half by falling telecommunication coststhanks to the diffusion of the telegraph, telephones, the PC, satellites, fiber-optic cable, and the early version of the World Wide Web.
It was during this era that we really THE WORLD IS FLAT saw the birth and maturation of a global economy, in the sense that there was enough movement of goods and information from continent to con tinent for there to be a global market, with global arbitrage in products and labor.
The Lexus and the Olive Tree was primarily about the climax of this era, an era when the walls started falling all around the world, and integration and the backlash to itwent to a whole new level.
Just a hint: The flat-world platform is the product of a convergence of the personal computer (which allowed every individual suddenly to become the author of his or her own content in digital form) with fiber-optic cable (which suddenly allowed all those individ uals to access more and more digital content around the world for next to nothing) with the rise of work flow software (which enabled individ- WHILE I WAS SLEEPING uals all over the world to collaborate on that same digital content from anywhere, regardless of the distances between them).
Bangalore is one of the most wired places in the world, and although there's a slight delayone second or lessin getting the information over there, it turns out you can just as easily sit in Bangalore and get the electronic version of a press release and turn it into a story as you can in London or New York."
I was wandering around the Microsoft section around six p.m. Bangalore time, when most of these young people start their workday to coincide with the dawn in America, when I asked a young Indian com puter expert there a simple question: What was the record on the floor for the longest phone call to help some American who got lost in the maze of his or her own software?
Mayor Xia had a charmingly direct way of describing the world, and THE WORLD IS FLAT although some of what he had to say gets lost in translation, he gets it and Americans should too: "The rule of the market economy," this Communist official explained to me, "is that if somewhere has the rich est human resources and the cheapest labor, of course the enterprises and the businesses will naturally go there."
I am convinced that the flattening of the world, if it continues, will be seen in time as one of those fundamental shifts or inflection points, like Gutenberg's invention of the printing press, the rise of the nation-state, or the Industrial Revolutioneach of which, in its day, noted Rothkopf, produced changes in the role of individuals, the role and form of gov ernments, the ways business was done and wars were fought, the role of women, the forms religion and art took, and the way science and re search were conducted, not to mention the political labels that we as a civilization have assigned to ourselves and to our enemies.
To put it another way, the experiences of the high-tech companies in the last few decades that failed to navigate the rapid changes brought about in their marketplace by these types of forces may be a warning to all the businesses, institutions, and nation-states that are now facing these inevitable, even predictable, changes but lack the leadership, flexibility, and imagination to adaptnot because they are not smart or aware, but because the speed of change is simply overwhelming them.
To some degree the termites just ate away at the foundations of the Soviet Union, which were already weakened by the system's own inter nal contradictions and inefficiencies; to some degree the Reagan admin istration's military buildup in Europe forced the Kremlin to bankrupt itself paying for warheads; and to some degree Mikhail Gorbachev's fu tile efforts to reform something that was unreformable brought commu nism to an end.
While the fall of the wall eliminated a physical and geopolitical barrierone that held back THE WORLD IS FLAT information, stood in the way of shared standards, and kept us from having a view of the world as a single unified communitythe rise of the Windows-enabled PC, which really popularized personal computing, eliminated another hugely important barrier: the limit on the amount of information that any single individual could amass, author, manipulate, and diffuse.
And once more and more people connected their Windows-enabled PCs with that global communications platform, which spread even THE WORLD IS FLAT more quickly after 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down (and China and India started opening to the global economy), there was nothing to stop the digital representation of everythingwords, music, photos, data, video and then the global exchange of all that digital informa tion.
As I said, this level of connectivity surely helped to put the nail in the coffin of communism, because the very tools that were being used to im prove productivity in the West (PCs, faxes, modems), even though much THE TEN FORCES THAT FLATTENED THE WORLD scarcer in the East, vastly improved horizontal person-to-person commu nication there, to the detriment of top-down Communist systems.
And once that mission had been accomplishedthe Soviets completed their pullout from Afghanistan on February 15, 1989, just nine months before the fall of the Berlin W a l l bin Laden looked around and found that the other superpower, the United States, had a huge presence in his own native land, Saudi Arabia, the home of the two holiest cities in Islam.
The "event" that made that happen was actually a coincidence of events that took place in the space of just a few years in the 1990sthe emergence of the Internet as a tool of low-cost global connectivity; the emergence, on top of the Internet, of the World Wide Web as a seem ingly magical virtual realm where individuals could post their digital content for everyone else to access; and, finally, the spread of the com mercial Web browser, which could retrieve documents or Web pages stored in Web sites and display them on any computer screen in such a simple manner that everyone wouldand didwant to use it.
Once the PC-Windows revolution demon strated to everyone the value of being able to digitize information and manipulate it on computers and word processors, and once the browser brought the Internet alive and made Web pages sing and dance and dis play, everyone wanted everything digitized as much as possible so they could send it to someone else down the Internet pipes.
The cable functions as a kind of light guide, guiding the light pulses introduced at one end of the cable through to the other end, where a light-sensitive receiver con verts the pulses back into the electronic digital Is and Os of the original signal, so they can then show up on your computer screen as e-mail or in your cell phone as a voice.
Just as the na tional highway system that was built in the 1950s flattened the United States, broke down regional differences, and made it so much easier for companies to relocate in lower-wage regions, like the South, because it had become so much easier to move people and goods long distances, so the laying of global fiber highways flattened the developed world.
"Every layer of innovation gets built on the next," said Andreessen, who went on from Netscape to start another high-tech firm, Opsware Inc. "And today the most profound thing to me is the fact that a fourteenyear-old in Romania or Bangalore or the Soviet Union or Vietnam has all the information, all the tools, all the software easily available to apply knowledge however they want.

Remember, before the diffusion of computers and the Internet, work flow consisted of your sales department taking an or der on paper over the phone, walking it over to your shipping depart ment, which shipped the product, and then someone from shipping walking over to billing with a piece of paper and instructing the billing department to churn out an invoice to the customer.
Your sales department could take an order over the phone or by mail, en ter it into a computer system, e-mail the order to the shipping depart ment within your own company, and then have the shipping department send out the product to the customer and automatically spit out a com puterized bill at the same time.
The more we con nect everyone through common communication standards, like XML, and then, on top of those protocols, connect more and more people through standardized business processes, said Cawley, the easier it is to THE TEN FORCES THAT FLATTENED THE WORLD chop up work and send pieces of it to be done anywhere in the world, and the more it increases productivity and enables my whole digital ecosystem to collaborate better, cheaper, and faster, and the more energy my employees have to concentrate on the high-touch, high-value-add, customized innovation or service that differentiates one company from another.
First, the falling of the walls, the opening of the Windows, and the rise of the PC all com bined to empower more individuals than ever to become authors of their own content in digital form.
Then the spread of the Internet and the com ing to life of the Web, thanks to the browser and fiber optics, enabled more people than ever to be connected and to share their digital content with more other people for less money than any time before.
But I am convinced that the genesis of this new flat-world platform and the six new forms of collaboration it has spawned will be remembered in time as one of the most important turning points in the history of mankindone no less significant than the invention of the printing press or electricity.
And the geeks in the dorm are increasingly offering up their own songs, and videos, and poetry, and rap, and commentary, to you and me and the rest of the world, cutting out the music stores and the traditional content providers.

"The Apache tribe was the last tribe to surrender to the oncoming U.S. government, and at the time we wor ried that the big companies would come in and 'civilize' the landscape that the early Internet engineers built.
"IBM said, 'We would like to figure out how we can use [Apache] and not get flamed by the Internet com munity, [how we can] make it sustainable and not just be ripping people off but contributing to the process...' IBM was saying that this new model for software development was trustworthy and valuable, so let's in vest in it and get rid of the one that we are trying to make on our own, which isn't as good."
What CollabNet does, for example, is to create a secure Web THE TEN FORCES THAT FLATTENED THE WORLD site, where those with a password can go and see the source code of the software and the defects that need to be addressed, and then participate in a discussion among engineers, product managers, and customer support on how the software should be improved.
The boom laid the able that connected India to the world, and the bust made the cost of us ng it virtually free and also vastly increased the number of American ompanies that would want to use that fiber-optic cable to outsource nowledge work to India.

Supply-chaining is both nabled by the flattening of the world and a hugely important flattener tself, because the more these supply chains grow and proliferate, the ore they force the adoption of common standards between companies so that every link of every supply chain can interface with the next), the ore they eliminate points of friction at borders, the more the efficien ies of one company get adopted by the others, and the more they en ourage global collaboration.
One can only hope hat all the bad publicity Wal-Mart has received in the last few years will orce it to understand that there is a fine line between a hyperefficient lobal supply chain that is helping people save money and improve their ives and one that has pursued cost cutting and profit margins to such a egree that whatever social benefits it is offering with one hand, it is tak ng away with the other.

Wealth and ower will increasingly accrue to those countries, companies, individuals, niversities, and groups who get three basic things right: the infrastructure o connect with this flat-world platform, the education to get more of their eople innovating on, working off of, and tapping into this platform, and, inally, the governance to get the best out of this platform and cushion its orst side effects.

andel startled me slightly by remarking that the sort of flattening rocess that I was describing was actually first identified by Karl Marx nd Friedrich Engels in the Communist Manifesto, published in 1848. hile the shrinking and flattening of the world that we are seeing today onstitute a difference of degree from what Marx saw happening in his  H E W O R L D IS F L A T ay, said Sandel, it is nevertheless part of the same historical trend Marx ighlighted in his writings on capitalism the inexorable march of tech ology and capital to remove all barriers, boundaries, frictions, and re traints to global commerce.
In the wake of the riple convergence, the more the flattening forces reduce friction and bar- HE GREAT SORTING OUT iers, the sharper the challenge they will pose to the nation-state and to he particular cultures, values, national identities, democratic traditions, nd bonds of restraint that have historically provided some protection and ushioning for workers and communities.

Think  H E W O R L D IS F L A T bout it: Social conservatives from the right wing of the Republican party, ho do not like globalization or closer integration with the world because t brings too many foreigners and foreign cultural mores into America, ight align themselves with unions from the left wing of the Democratic arty, who don't like globalization for the way it facilitates the outsourcing nd offshoring of jobs.
Let's face it: Republican cultural onservatives have much more in common with the steelworkers of oungstown, Ohio, the farmers of rural China, and the mullahs of central audi Arabia, who would also like more walls, than they do with invest ent bankers on Wall Street or service workers linked to the global econ my in Palo Alto, who have been enriched by the flattening of the world.

M E R I C A AND F R E E T R A D E hat is the simple message of this chapter: Even as the world gets lat, America as a whole will benefit more by sticking to the general rinciples of free trade, as it always has, than by trying to erect walls, hich will only provoke others to do the same and impoverish us all.
M E R I C A AND F R E E T R A D E hat is why America, as a whole, will do fine in a flat world with free radeprovided it continues to churn out knowledge workers who are ble to produce idea-based goods that can be sold globally and who are ble to fill the knowledge jobs that will be created as we not only expand he global economy but connect all the knowledge pools in the world to ether.
If we go from a world in which there were fifteen drug companies nd fifteen software companies in America (thirty in all) and two drug ompanies and two software companies in China (four in all) to a world n which there are thirty drug and software companies in America and hirty drug and software companies in China, it is going to mean more nnovation, more cures, more niches to specialize in, more new products o customize to individuals or markets, and many more people with igher incomes to buy those products.
But as long as the pie eeps growing and getting more complex, and as long as the individuals n your country keep adding to that pie by imagining new services and roducts in which to specialize, and as long as those individuals keep ducating themselves and developing the skills needed to master these  H E W O R L D IS F L A T ew jobs, workers in India, China, Europe, and America can all do ell at the same time.
And the more they do that, the higher they limb, the more room is created at the top because the more they ave, the more they spend, the more diverse product markets become, nd the more niches for specialization are created as well.

As a result of the ability to HE U N T O U C H A B L E S ove work around, we have created an amazing awareness on the part of very individual that says: 'Not only does my work have to fit into some ody's global supply chain, but I myself have to understand how I need o compete and have the skill sets required to work at a pace that fits the upply chain.
Because the companies that are adjusting best to the flat world are  H E W O R L D IS F L A T ot just making minor changes, they are changing the whole model of the ork they do and how they do itin order to take advantage of the flatworld platform and to compete with others who are doing the same.
herefore, of the many things we need to do, in my view the most im ortant is to identify the new middle jobs that will be less vulnerable to he downward wage pressures of outsourcing, automation, and techno ogical change and to identify the particular skills and education they ill demandso that more weakers can reap the benefits.
To pull that off, though, e have had to combine the best of what computers and telecommuni ations can offer with the best-trained workforce we can build, and then onstantly reintegrate the best practices and new skills being honed by hat workforce with the best new technologies to make the wholethe achines and the peoplemore and more productive.
At a moment HE RIGHT STUFF ike this one, I feel it would be useful to step back, take a deep breath, and sk: If the strategies detailed in the previous chapter really are going to be he best way for individuals to obtain and retain jobs in the new middle, hen, generally speaking, what is the right kind of education to prepare ur young people for those jobs?
ne of the best examples of that I can think of is the story that Steve obs, the cofounder of Apple Computer, told about himself in a com encement speech at Stanford University (June 12, 2005):  am honored to be with you today at your commencement from ne of the finest universities in the world.

IRTY LITTLE SECRET #1: THE NUMBERS GAP  rty little secret number one is that the generation of scientists and ngineers who were motivated to go into science by the threat of putnik in 1957 and the inspiration of JFK are reaching their retirement ears and are not being replaced in the numbers that they must be if an dvanced economy like that of the United States is to remain at the head f the pack.
These trends threaten he economic welfare and security of our country, it said, adding that if he trends identified in Indicators 2004 continue undeterred, three hings will happen: "The number of jobs in the U.S. economy that re uire science and engineering training will grow; the number of U.S. cit zens prepared for those jobs will, at best, be level; and the availability of eople from other countries who have science and engineering training ill decline, either because of limits to entry imposed by U.S. national ecurity restrictions or because of intense global competition for people ith these skills."

hat all these leaders confronted was the irrefutable fact that more pen and competitive markets are the only sustainable vehicle for grow ng a nation out of poverty, because they are the only guarantee that new deas, technologies, and best practices will easily flow into your country nd that private enterprises, and even government, will have the com etitive incentive and flexibility to adopt those new ideas and turn them nto jobs and products.
According to the IFC report, if you want to create pro uctive jobs (the kind that lead to rising standards of living), and if you ant to stimulate the growth of new businesses (the kind that innovate, ompete, and create wealth), you need a regulatory environment that akes it easy to start a business, easy to adjust a business to changing mar et circumstances and opportunities, and easy to close a business that goes ankrupt, so that the capital can be freed up for more productive uses.

He ar ues that although climate, natural resources, and geography all help to xplain why some countries are able to make the leap to industrialization nd others are not, the key factor is actually a country's cultural endow ents, particularly the degree to which it has internalized the values of ard work, thrift, honesty, patience, and tenacity, as well as the degree to hich it is open to change, new technology, and equality for women.
y that I mean, to what degree is there a sense of national solidarity and  focus on development, to what degree is there trust within the society or strangers to collaborate together, and to what degree are the elites in he country concerned with the masses and ready to invest at home, or  H E W O R L D IS F L A T re they indifferent to their own poor and more interested in investing broad?
These are primarily wo qualities: a society's ability and willingness to pull together and sacri ice for the sake of economic development and the presence in a society f leaders with the vision to see what needs to be done in terms of devel pment and the willingness to use power to push for change rather than o enrich themselves and preserve the status quo.
They are the ones that recognizefaster than their competi orseverything new that the flattening of the world enables and every hing new that it enjoins and are the first to develop strategies to exploit he new possibilities and to cope with the new requirements.
ecause if whatever can be done will be done, then the society that is ost open to what is being done anywhere in the world, most open to the ompetition, while also being most inviting of its own people and immi rants to imagine and do whatever can be done, is the society that will hrive the most.
Ghandour's and Kingson's brainstorm was to approach  H E W O R L D IS F L A T merican companies, like Federal Express and Airborne Express, that id not have a Middle East presence and offer to become their local de ivery service, playing on the fact that an Arab company would know the egion and how to get around unpleasantries like Arab-Israeli clashes, the ran-Iraq war, and the American invasion of Iraq.
Today, said Caplan, "On one page you can now see exactly where ou stand in terms of your brokerage in real time, including your buying OW C O M P A N I E S C O P E ower, and you see your bank account and the scheduled payments for our loanswhat is pending, what is the balance on your home mort age, and [what is your] line of creditand you have the ability to move eamlessly between all three to maximize the benefit of your cash."
s I noted earlier, many of the new middle jobs will go to people who re great synthesizersbecause the more the flattening of the world con ects all the knowledge pools together, the more new specialties will be pawned, and the more innovation will come from putting these special ies together in new and different combinations.
What if I told you, though, that Rolls-Royce doesn't even make ars anymore (that business was sold in 1972 and the brand was licensed o B M W in 1998), that 50 percent of its income comes from services, nd that in 1990 all of its employees were in Great Britain and today 40 OW C O M P A N I E S C O P E ercent are based outside of the United Kingdom, integrated into a lobal operation that stretches from China to Singapore to India to Italy o Spain to Germany to Japan and up to Scandinavia?
In short, said Rose, "We still own the key technologies,  H E W O R L D IS F L A T e own the ability to identify and define what product is required by our ustomers, we own the ability to integrate the latest science into making hese products, we own the route to the market for these products, and e own the ability to collect and understand the data generated by those ustomers using our products, enabling us to support that product while n service and constantly add value."
And if you are a multiproduct company, you are probably going o have some manufacturing relationships in Malaysia and China, some esign in Taiwan, some customer support in India and the Philippines, nd possibly some engineering in Russia and the U.S." These are the socalled micromultinationals, and they are the wave of the future.
What's the difference in output, rom our clients' point of view, between the giant company who hires a id designer and puts him in front of a computer, and our company that ires a kid designer and puts him in front of a computer, and the kid de igner with a computer in his own basement?
ou and the lat World WELVE lobalization of the Local he Cultural Revolution Is About to Begin   1999 book The Lexus and the Olive Tree attempted to de cribe the forces that were globalizing the world at the end of he twentieth century and their effects on economics, politics, eopolitics, environment, and culture.
After the first edition of The World s Flat first came out, several readers complained to me that I had not fol owed up on the cultural part of my argument in The Lexus and the Olive reeI had made no mention of how this new flattening era of global zation, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, was affecting culture round the world.
A young ndian engineer no longer has to stand in line outside the U.S. embassy n New Delhi and pray to win the lottery and secure a visa to America so hat he or she can move to frigid Minnesota and give up his or her native ress, native cuisine, native music, and extended familyall the things hat make up a native culture just to get a decent engineering job at M. That is a very good thing for the preservation of Indian local culture.
he kind of globalization we are talking about nowwith the nternet and the flattening of the world"is a different kind of globaliza ion than the one that is in the minds of the people who have been criti izing globalization," remarked Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi.
Some are business school grads with the soul of eace Corps volunteers, some are political activists with a knack for sing the Web to raise money or raise an army, some are environmen alists who hope to save the planet by tutoring the biggest corporations on ow to increase their profits by getting green, and some are philan hropists who see in the proliferation of low-cost communication devices  whole new tool kit to help the poor help themselves.
he new model in business is that you involve your community and cus omers in an ongoing conversation about every aspect of your business, rom the moment you conceive a product, to how you design it, to the upply chain that builds it and delivers it, to the way you collect and ab orb customer feedback and respond more quickly to changing tastes.
uture elections, note Rasiej and Sifry, are sure to be even further affected y the scope and reach of the Internet, "with all kinds of voter-generated ontent, citizen activism, social networks, and the power of the technol gy to force transparency in the electoral process and in government."
As a founding member and vol nteer for the U.S. Green Building Council, I founded the EED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green uilding rating system, which due to the dedication of hun reds of volunteers like myself and tireless efforts of the USGBC taffhas become the premier green building certification sys em in the world.
o wonder people have to do online dating: Your chances of a hance encounter now on a ski lift or on a train or a bus are so much ower today than they used to be, because the chances that the person sit ing next to you will be absorbed in a handheld device, rather than being pen to engaging the person next to him or her, are so much higher.
hen the students showed up for class the following day, she sked them to read a paragraph she had written using many of the ame phrases they used in their papers, "chaucer's the canterbury ales r a scathing attack on the catholic church of the late  H A T H A P P E N S W H E N W E A L L HAVE D O G ' S H E A R I N G ?
The police were able to determine that the computers used o create the site were located in the students' homes, and [the] lawsuit ays that the parents have a duty to know what their children are up to."
Intrigued, I alled her husband, Brian, and he picked up the story: "At the end of the eriod, when all of the tests were being passed up to the front of the class oom, this student very quickly and slyly pulled out his cell phone and omehow snapped a picture of some test questions, and instantly e-mailed t to his friend who was taking the same test the next period.
So the Gates Foundation placed ads on he Web and in more conventional channels across both the developed nd the developing worlds, asking scientists to respond to one big ques ion: What are the biggest problems that, if science attended to them and olved them, could most dramatically change the fate of the several bil ion people trapped in the vicious cycle of infant mortality, low life ex ectancy, and disease?
And, from the other side, it would ake the economic devastation from such a pandemic so much greater nd more sudden, because our natural response to pandemics is to put p walls and to sever connectivity and face-to-face contactsince the ovement and interaction of both people and goods is precisely what preads something like the influenza virus.
ichael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease esearch and Policy and professor at the University of Minnesota's chool of Public Health, notes that the spread of the SARS (Severe Acute espiratory Syndrome) virus in 2003 demonstrated just how quickly such n infectious disease can move in a flattening world, given the speed and ensity of international air travel.
It has to be by refocusing the energies of the global populist ovement on how to improve local government, infrastructure, and ed cation in places like rural India and China, so the populations there an acquire the tools to collaborate and participate in the flat world.
But one need only look at the eadlines in any day's newspaper to appreciate that a lot of anger and frus ration seems to be boiling over from the Muslim world in general and rom the Arab-Muslim world in particular, where many young people  H E W O R L D IS F L A T eem to be agitated by a combination of issues.
We trust when we park our car downtown in he morning that the car next to it is not going to blow up; we trust when e go to Disney World that the man in the Mickey Mouse outfit is not earing a bomb-laden vest underneath; we trust when we get on the huttle flight from Boston to New York that the foreign student seated ext to us isn't going to blow up his tennis shoes.
But unlike the Lenin sts, who wanted to install the reign of the perfect class, the working class, nd unlike Nazis, who wanted to install the reign of the perfect race, the ryan race, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri wanted to install the reign of the erfect religion.
And the problem is that so many Muslims ant both stagnation and power: they want a return to the perfection of the HE UNFLAT WORLD eventh century and to dominate the twenty-first, as they believe is the irthright of their doctrine, the last testament of God to man.
s I said, however, this frustration and humiliation are not confined to  H E W O R L D IS F L A T he Islamistfringes.The reason the Islamo-Leninists have become the most nergized and pronounced opponents of globalization/Americanization nd the biggest threat to the flattening of the world today is not simply their xtraordinary violence, but also that they enjoy some passive support round the Arab-Muslim world.
ut the other reason for the passive support that the Islamo-Leninists njoyand the fact that they are able to raise so much money through harities and mosques in the Arab-Muslim world is that too many ood, decent people there feel the same frustration and tinge of humili tion that many of their most enraged youth do.
"Despite the fact that bin Laden murdered housands of innocents in the name of our religion and despite the dam ge that he has caused to Muslims everywhere, and especially to innocent uslims in the West, whose life is much better than the life of Muslims n Islamic lands, to this date not a single fatwa has been issued calling for he killing of bin Laden, on the pretext that bin Laden still proclaims there is no God other than Allah,'" Tefla wrote.
If millions of people from India, hina, Latin America, and the former Soviet Empire, who for years had een living largely outside the flat world, all start to walk onto the new flatworld platformeach with his or her own version of the American dream f owning a car, a house, a refrigerator, a microwave, and a toasterwe re, at best, going to experience a serious energy shortage.
All the best, Michael he thirty thousand new cars a month in Beijing, and the cloud of aze that envelops the city on so many days, and the fact that the city's of icial Web site actually keeps track of "blue sky" days all testify to the envi- HE UNFLAT WORLD onmental destruction that could arise from the triple convergence if lean alternative renewable energies are not developed soon.
"China is following the ath of Japan and Korea," said the executive, on the condition that he nd his company not be quoted by name, "and the big question is, Can he world afford to have 1.3 billion people following that path and driv ng the same cars and using the same amount of energy?
he reluctance of the Bush team to develop such a comprehensive eo-green strategywhich would strengthen the dollar, reduce our trade eficit, make America the world leader in combating climate change, nd stimulate U.S. companies to take the lead in producing the green echnologies that the world will desperately need as China and India in ustrializehas been so irresponsible that it takes your breath away.
To all the forces mentioned in the previous chap er that are still holding back the flattening of the world, or could actually everse the process, one has to add a more traditional threat, and that is an utbreak of a good, old-fashioned, world-shaking, economy-destroying ar.
Because the disadvantage of being in a flat world is that de pite all the nice engagements and stuff and the exit barriers that you ave, every customer has multiple options, and so the sense of responsi ility you have is not just out of a desire to do good by your customers, ut also a desire for self-preservation."
If we are not going o shut down the Internet and all the other creative and collaborative ools that have flattened the world, and if we can't restrict access to them, he only thing we can do is try to influence the imagination and inten ions that people bring to them and draw from them.
In or about June 2001, in orman, Oklahoma, Zacarias Moussaoui made inquiries about starting a ropdusting company...

Because only through this recognition will we begin to fo us on the truly critical issuesan effective multilateral response to eapons of mass destruction proliferation, the creation of real stakehold rs in globalization among the world's poor, the need for reform in the rab world, and a style of U.S. leadership that seeks to build our base of upport worldwide by getting more people to voluntarily sign onto our alues.
his is not all that complicated: Give young people a context where hey can translate a positive imagination into reality, give them a context n which someone with a grievance can have it adjudicated in a court of aw without having to bribe the judge with a goat, give them a context in hich they can pursue an entrepreneurial idea and become the richest r the most creative or most respected people in their own country, no atter what their background, give them a context in which any com laint or idea can be published in the newspaper, give them a context in hich anyone can run for officeand guess what?
