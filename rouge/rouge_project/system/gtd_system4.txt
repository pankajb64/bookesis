The methods I present here are all based on two key objectives:(1) capturing all the things that need to get donenow, later, someday, big, little, or in betweeninto a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind; and (2) disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of me "inputs" you THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE | PART ONE let into your life so that you will always have a plan for "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.
In the course of a single recent week, I consulted with a partner in a major global investment firm who was concerned that the new corporate-management responsibilities he was being offered would stress his family commitments beyond the limits; and with a midlevel human-resources manager trying to stay on top of her 150-plus e-mail requests per day fueled by the goal of doubling the company's regional office staff from eleven hundred to two thousand people in one year, all as she tried to protect a social life for herself on the weekends.

CHAPTER 1 I A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY The Real Work of Knowledge Work Welcome to the real-life experience of "knowledge work," and a profound operational principle: You have to think about your stuff more than you realize but not as much as you're afraid you might.
Why Things Are on Your Mind Most often, the reason something is "on your mind" is that you want it to be different than it currently is, and yet:  you haven't clarified exactly what the intended outcome is;  you haven't decided what the very next physical action step is; and/or  you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust.
The vast majority of people have been trying to get organized by rearranging incomplete lists of THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE unclear things; they haven't yet realized how much and what they need to organize in order to get the real payoff.
After all:  you don't manage five minutes and wind up with six;  you don't manage information overloadotherwise you'd walk into a library and die, or the first time you connected to the Web, or even opened a phone book, you'd blow up; and  you don't manage prioritiesyou have them.
Managing Action Is the Prime Challenge What you do with your time, what you do with information, and what you do with your body and your focus relative to your CHAPTER 1 I A NEW PRACTICE FOR ANEW REALITY prioritiesthose are the real options to which you must allocate your limited resources.
In training and coaching thousands of professionals, I have found that lack of time is not the major issue for them (though they themselves may think it is); the real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project Things rarely get really is, and what the associated next-action steps stuck because of required are.
But if you made that kind of review a characteristic of your ongoing life- and work style, and you maintained it across all areas of your life (not just the most "urgent"), you'd be practicing the kind of "black belt" management style I'm describing.
Sally Kempton means that as soon as you tell yourself that you need to do something, and store it in your RAM, there's a part of you that thinks you should be doing that something all the time.
In order for your mind to let go of the lower-level task of trying to hang on THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE | PART ONE to everything, you have to know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something you have to do, and that at some point in the near future you will process and review all of it.
Gathering 100 Percent of the "Incompletes" In order to eliminate "holes in the bucket," you need to collect and gather together placeholders for or representations of all the things you consider incomplete in your worldthat is, anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.
Emptying the bucket does not mean that you have to finish what's in your voice-mail, e-mail, or in-basket; it just means you have to take it out of the container, decide what it is and what should be done with it, and, if it's still unfinished, organize it into your system.
When the head of a major department in a global corporation had finished processing all her open items with me, she sat back in awe and told me that though she had been able to relax about what meetings to go to thanks to her trust in her calendar, she had never felt that same relief about all the many other aspects of her job, which we had just clarified together.
The whole dealboth the processing and THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE WORKFLOW DIAGRAMPROCESSING CHAPTER 2 | GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF MASTERING WORKFLOW organizing phasesis captured in the center "trunk" of the decision-tree model shown here.
To manage actionable things, you will need a list of projects, storage or files for project plans and materials, a calendar, a list of reminders of next actions, and a list of reminders of things you're waiting for.
Support Materials and Reference Files Once you have organized your project support material by theme or topic, you will probably find that it is almost identical to your reference material and could be kept in the same reference file system (a "Wedding" file could be kept in the general-reference files, for instance).
There will be times, though, when it'll be more convenient to have the materials out and instantly in view and available, especially if you're working on a hot project that you need to check references for several times during the day.
What does need to be tracked is every action that has to happen at a specific time or on a specific day (enter these in your calendar); those that need to be done as soon as they can (add these to your "Next Actions" lists); and all those that you are waiting for others to do (put these on a "Waiting For" list).

The Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work When you're getting things done, or "working" in the universal sense, there are three different kinds of activities you can be engaged in:  Doing predefined work  Doing work as it shows up  Defining your work Doing Predefined Work When you're doing predefined work, you're working off your "Next Actions" listscompleting tasks that you have previously determined need to be done, managing your workflow.
50,000+ feet: Life  40,000 feet: Three- to five-year vision  30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals  20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility  10,000 feet: Current projects  Runway: Current actions Let's start from the bottom up: Runway: Current Actions This is the accumulated list of all the actions you need to takeall the phone calls you have to make, the e-mails you have to respond to, the errands you've got to run, and the agendas you want to communicate to your boss and your spouse.
10,000 Feet: Current Projects Creating many of the actions that you currently have in front of you are the thirty to one hundred THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE projects on your plate.
Sometimes, however, you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project under control, to identify a solution, The goal is to get or to ensure that all the right steps have been deterprojects and mined.
Most of the thinking you'll need to do is informal, what I call back-of-the-envelope planningthe kind of thing you do literally on the back of an envelope in a coffee shop with a colleague as you're hashing out the agenda and structure of CHAPTER 3 | GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING a sales presentation.
Finally (assuming that you're really committed to the project in this case, going out to dinner), you focus on the next action that you need to take to make the first component actually happen.
When you really know the underlying "why"for the conference, for the staff party, for the If you're not sure elimination of the management position, or for the why you're doing mergerit expands your thinking about how to something, you can never do enough make the desired result happen.
CHAPTER 3 I GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING Vision/Outcome In order most productively to access the conscious and unconscious resources available to you, you must have a clear picture in your mind of what success would look, sound, and feel like.
When you focus on somethingthe vacation you're going to take, the meeting you're about to go into, the product you want to launchthat focus instantly creates ideas and thought patterns you wouldn't have had otherwise.
THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE The Reticular Activating System The May 1957 issue of Scientific American contained an article describing the discovery of the reticular formation at the base of the brain.
It can be CHAPTER 3 I GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING quite a challenge, however, to identify with images of You often need to success if they represent new and foreign territory make it up in your that is, if you have few reference points about what mind before you an event might actually look like and little experience can make it happen in your life.
Although the authors of these various processes may portray them as being different from one another, for most of us end-users the basic premise remains the same: give yourself permission to capture and express any idea, and then later on figure out how it fits in and what to do with it.
That's why good thinking can happen while you're working on a computer document about a project, mind-mapping it on a legal pad of on a paper tablecloth in a hip restaurant, or just having a meeting about it with other people in a room that allows you to hold the context (a whiteboard with nice wet markers really helps there, too).
Making a list can be a creative thing to do, a way to consider the people who should be on your team, the customer requirements for the software, or the components of the business plan.
If there's CHAPTER 3 I GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING a lack of clarity at the planning level, there's probably a need for more brainstorming to generate a sufficient inventory of ideas to create trust in the plan.
If the brainstorming session gets bogged down with fuzzy thinking, the focus should shift back to the vision of the outcome, ensuring that the reticular filter in the brain will open up to deliver the best how-to thinking.
THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE And if there is a plan, but the rubber still isn't hitting the road like it should, someone needs to assess each component with the focus of "What's the next action, and who's got it?"
In the last two chapters, I have covered the basic models of how to stay maximally productive and in control, with minimal effort, at the two most basic levels of our life and work: the actions we take and the projects we enter into that generate many of those actions.
The fundamentals remain trueyou must be You need no new responsible for collecting all your open loops, applyskills to increase ing a front-end thought process to each of them, and your productivity- managing the results with organization, review, and just a new set of action.

* For many of the executives I work with, holding the world back for two contiguous days is the hardest part of the whole process the perceived necessity to be constantly available for meetings and communications when they're "at work" is difficult for them to let go of.
Later on you can *After hours is actually a good time to crank through a group of similar tasks that you wouldn't normally do in the course of your typical workday, like filing a big backlog of papers, organizing photographs, surfing the Web about your upcoming vacation location, or processing expense receipts.
Lists can be managed simply in a low-tech way, as pieces of paper kept in a file folder (e.g., separate sheets/notes for each person you need to call in a "Calls" file), or they can be arranged in a more "mid-tech" fashion, in loose-leaf notebooks or planners (a page titled "Calls" with the names listed down the sheet).
tem can be one of the greatest obstacles to imple- CHAPTER 4 | GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND TOOLS menting a personal management system, and for most of the executives I have personally coached, it represents one of the biggest opportunities for improvement.
Many times I have driven to the local office-supply store with a client and bought a filing cabinet, a big stock of file folders, and a labeler, just so we could create an appropriate place in which to put two-thirds of the "stuff" lying around his/her desk and credenza and even on the office floors.
If you have to get up every time you have some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, you'll tend to stack it instead of filing it, and you're also likely to just resist the whole in-basket process (because you subconsciously know there's stuff in there that might need filing!).
Get Rid of Hanging Files If You Can At the risk of seriously offending a lot of people who are already using hanging files, I recommend that you totally do away with the hanging-file hardware and use just plain folders standing up by themselves in the CHAPTER 4 | GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND TOOLS file drawer, held up by the movable metal plate in the back.
There are very practical reasons to gather everything before you start processing it: 1 | it's helpful to have a sense of the volume of stuff you have to deal with; 2 | it lets you know where the "end of the tunnel" is; and 3 | when you're processing and organizing, you don't want to be distracted psychologically by an amorphous mass of stuff that might still be "somewhere."
PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I PART TWO Issues About Collecting As you engage in the collecting phase, you may run into one or more of the following:  you've got a lot more than will fit into one in-basket;  you're likely to get derailed into purging and organizing;  you may have some form of stuff already collected and organized; and/or  you're likely to run across some critical things that you want to keep in front of you.
If you can't deal with the action in the moment, and you still just have to have the reminder right in front of you, go ahead and create an "emergency" stack somewhere close at hand.
Information Delegated tasks/projects Completions critical to projects Replies to: Letters Memos Calls Proposals Requisitions Reimbursements Petty cash Insurance Ordered items Items being repaired Tickets Decisions of others Professional development Training/seminars Things to learn Things to look up Skills to practice/learn especially re: computers Tape/video training Resumes Outside education Research need to find out about...

In addition to the paper-based and physical items in your inbasket, your inventory of "in" should include any resident voicemails and all the e-mails that are currently staged in the "in" area of your communication software.
Top Item First Even if the second item down is a personal note to you from the president of your country, and the top item is a piece of junk mail, you've got to process the junk mail first!
One Item at a Time You may find you have a tendency, while processing your inbasket, to pick something up, not know exactly what you want to do about it, and then let your eyes wander onto another item farther down the stack and get engaged with it.
The point of all of these incubation procedures is that they give you a way to get the items off your mind right now and let you feel confident that some reminder of the possible action will resurface at an appropriate time.
The next action should be easy to figure out, but there are often some quick analyses and several planning steps that haven't occurred yet in your mind, and these have to happen before you can determine precisely what has to happen to complete the item, even if it's a fairly simple one.
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that that's more or less the point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal with it the first time it's in your hands-in other words, it's the efficiency cutoff.
For instance, if you act to replace the cartridge in your favorite pen and discover that you're out of cartridge refills, you'll want to decide on the next action about getting them ("Buy refills at the store") and do, delegate, or defer it appropriately.
If you're passing on paper-based material as part of the handoff, a written communication is obviously the way to go; as with e-mail, the person you hand it off to can then deal with it on his or her own schedule.
A call you need to make to a customer; an e-mail you need to spend a little time thinking about and drafting to your team; a gift you need to buy for your brother at the stationery store; a piece of software you need to download from the Web and PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I PART TWO try out; a conversation you must have with your spouse about an investment you think you should makeall of these fit that description.
For the moment, go ahead and put Postits on the pieces of paper in "in," with the action written on them, and add these to the "Pending" stack of papers that have been processed.
The "Pending" Things That Are Left If you follow the instructions in this chapter, you'll dump a mess of things, file a bunch, do a lot of two-minute actions, and hand off a number of items to other people.
Identifying the Projects You Have This last step in getting to the bottom of "in" requires a shift in perspective from the single-action details to the larger picture your projects.
There's still going to be something about "car alarm" to CHAPTER 6 | PROCESSING: GETTING "IN" TO EMPTY do after the call to Frank, and there will still be something to handle about the conference after the e-mail to Bernadette.
I hope you're able to see the very practical reason for defining projects as broadly as I do: If the action step you've identified will not complete the commitment, then you'll need some stake in the ground to keep reminding you Right now you of actions you have pending until you have closure.
Organizing: Setting Up the Right Buckets HAVING A TOTAL and seamless system of organization in place gives you tremendous power because it allows your mind to let go of lower-level thinking and graduate to intuitive focusAirtight organization ing, undistracted by matters that haven't been dealt is required for your focus to remain on the broader horizon.
CHAPTER 7 | ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS WORKFLOW DIAGRAMORGANIZING PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO The Basic Categories There are seven primary types of things that you'll want to keep track of and manage from an organizational perspective:  A "Projects" list  Project support material  Calendared actions and information  "Next Actions" lists  A "Waiting For" list  Reference material  A "Someday/Maybe" list The Importance of Hard Edges It's critical that all of these categories be kept pristinely distinct from one another.
If you have a project that you're not going to be doing anything about for some time, it must go onto your "Someday/Maybe" list so you can relate to the "Projects" list with the rigorous action-generating focus it needs.
All You Really Need Is Lists and Folders Once you know what you need to keep track of (covered in the previous chapter, on Processing), all you really need is lists and CHAPTER 7 | ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS folders for reference and support materials.
The list is just a way for you to keep track of the total inventory of active things to which you have made a commitment, and to have that inventory available for review.
A list could look like one of three things: (1) a file folder with separate paper notes for the items within the category; (2) an actual list on a titled piece of paper (often within a loose-leaf organizer or planner); or (3) an inventory in a software program or on a digital assistant, such as Microsoft Outlook task categories or a category on a handheld PDA.
The Actions That Go on Your Calendar For the purposes of organization, as I've said, there are two basic kinds of actions: those that must be done on a certain day and/or at a particular time, and those that just need to be done as soon as you can get to them, around your other calendared items.
You may have realized that the next action on The calendar should getting a medical checkup, for example, was to call show only the "hard and make the appointment, and so (since the action landscape" around required two minutes or less) you actually did it when which you do the it occurred to you.
What many people want to do, however, based CHAPTER 7 | ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS on old habits of writing daily to-do lists, is put actions on the calendar that they think they'd really like to get done next Monday, say, but that then actually might not, and that might then have to be taken over to following days.
When the calendar is relegated to its proper role in organizing, the majority of the actions that you need to do are left in the category of "as soon as possible, against all the other things I have to do."
Organizing As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context Over many years I have discovered that the best way to be reminded of an "as soon as I can" action is by the particular context required for that actionthat is, either the tool or the location or the person needed to complete it.
If, however, you have fifty or a hundred next actions pending, keeping all of those on one big list would make it too difficult to see what you needed to see; each time you got any window of time to do something, you'd have to do unproductive resorting.
The Most Common Categories of Action Reminders You'll probably find that at least a few of the following common list headings for next actions will make sense for you:  "Calls"  "At Computer" "Errand's"  "Office Actions" or "At Office" (miscellaneous)  "At Home"  "Agendas" (for people and meetings)  "Read/Review" "Calls" This is the list of all the phone calls you need to make; you can work off it as long as you have a phone available.
"At Computer" If you work with a computerparticularly if you move around with a laptop or have a PC at work and another one at homeit can be helpful to group all those actions that you need to do when it's on and running.
This will allow you to see all your options for computer work to do, reminding you of all the e-mails you need to send, the documents you need to draft or edit, and so on.
"Office Actions'/"At Office" If you work in an office, there will be certain things that you can do only there, and a list of those will be a useful thing to have in front of you thenthough obviously, if you have a phone and a computer in your office, and you have "Calls" and "At Computer" as separate lists, they'll be in play as well.
Standing meetings You have to talk to your partner about an idea for next year; you want to check with your spouse about and people you deal with on an ongoing his schedule for the spring; you need to delegate a task to your secretary that's too complicated to basis may need their own "Agenda" explain in an e-mail.
Organizing "Waiting For" Like reminders of the actions you need to do, reminders of all the things that you're waiting to get back from or get done by others have to be sorted and grouped.
You won't necessarily be tracking discrete action steps here, but more often final deliverables or projects that others are responsible for, such as the tickets you've ordered from the theater, the scanner that's coming for the office, the OK on the proposal from your client, and so on.
Your role is to review that list as often as you need to and assess whether you ought to be taking an action such as checking the status or lighting a fire under the project.
If the next action on a service order is to make a call, it should be in a "Calls" group; if the action step is to review information and input it into the computer, it should be labeled "At Computer."
It means that you've DELETED what you could, FILED what you wanted to keep but don't need to act on, DONE the less-than-two-minute responses, and moved into your reminder folders all the things you're waiting for and all your actionable e-mails.
If you haven't done so already, I recommend that initially you make a "Projects" list in a very simple format, similar to the ones you've used for your lists of actions: it can be a category in a digital organizer, a page in a loose-leaf planner, or even a single file folder labeled "PROJECTS," with either a master list or separate sheets of paper for each one.
The real value of the "Projects" list lies in the current "Projects" complete review it can provide (at least once a week), list is the major allowing you to ensure that you have action steps operational tool for defined for all of your projects, and that nothing is moving from treeslipping through the cracks.
Frankly, it doesn't matter how many different lists of projects you have, so long as you look at the contents of all of them as often as you need to, since for the most part you'll do that in one fell swoop during your Weekly Review.
While you could, of course, put them on your "Waiting For" list, it might make better sense to create a "ProjectsDelegated" list to track CHAPTER 7 | ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS them: your task will be simply to review the list regularly enough to ensure that everything on it is moving along appropriately.
If you make the large project your one listing on your "Projects" list, you'll want to keep a list of the subprojects and/or the project plan itself as "project support material" to be reviewed when you come to that major item.
If you're not * sure, I'd vote for putting your Big Projects on the "Projects" list and holding the subpieces in your project support How you list material, making sure to include them in your projects and Weekly Review, If that arrangement doesn't feel subprojects is up to quite right, try including the active and independent you; just be sure subprojects as separate entries on your master list.
The problem is that next actions and "Waiting For" items on these projects have usually not been determined and are psychologically still embedded in the stacks and the folders giving them the aura of just more "stuff" that repels its (un)organizer instead of attracting him or her to action.
When you're on the run, in the heat of the activities of the day, files like that are the last thing you'll want to pick up and peruse for actions.
To return to the previous example of moving into a new house, you could have a folder labeled "New House" containing all the plans and details and notes about the landscaping and the kitchen and the basement.
The problem here is that some material is just facts or historical data that needs to be stored as background for when you might be able to use it, and some of what must be tracked is the actions required to move the relationships forward.
If you're keeping a "Projects" list within the software, you can go to the project you had a thought about, open or attach a "note" to it, and type in your idea.
You need to feel projects, priorities, comfortable storing even a single piece of paper that you might want to refer to later, and your system must be informal and accessible enough that it's a snap to file it away in your alphabetized general-reference system, right at hand where you work.
For instance, if you're managing a corporate merger and need to keep hold of a lot of the paperwork, you may want to dedicate two or three whole file cabinets to all the documentation required in the due-diligence process.
These could range from a special trip you might want to take one day, to books you might want to read, to projects you might want to tackle in the next fiscal year, to skills and talents you might want to develop.
If you acknowledge the power of the imagination to foster changes in perception and performance, it's easy to see how having a "Someday/Maybe" list out in front of your conscious mind could potentially add many wonderful adventures to your life and work.
to acquire  Trips to take  Organizations to join  Service projects to contribute to  Things to see and do Reassess Your Current Projects Now's a good time to review your "Projects" list from a more elevated perspective (that is, the standpoint of your job and goals) and consider whether you might transfer some of your current commit- What lies in our ments to "Someday/Maybe."
These kinds of lists can be a cross between reference and "Someday/Maybe"reference because you can just collect and add to lists of good wines or restaurants or books, to consult as you like; "Someday/Maybe" because you might want to review the listed items on a regular basis to remind yourself to try one or more of them at some point.
Usually much of that stuff needs to be tossed, some of it needs to go into "Read/Review," some needs to be filed as reference, some belongs on the calendar or in a tickler file (see page 173) for review in a month or perhaps at the beginning of the next quarter, and some actually has next actions on it.
Here are a few of the myriad things you should consider inserting:  Triggers for activating projects  Events you might want to participate in  Decision catalysts Triggers for Activating Projects If you have a project that you don't really need to think about now but that deserves a flag at some point in the future, you can pick an appropriate date and put a reminder about the project in your calendar for that day.
Essentially the tickler is a simple file-folder system that allows you to distribute paper and other physical reminders in such a way that whatever you want to see on a particular date in the future "automatically" shows up that day in your in-basket.
In the same way, when the next monthly file reaches the front (on October 31 after you empty the daily file, the "November" file will be the next one, with the daily files "1" through "31" behind it), it's emptied into the in-basket and refiled at the back of the monthlies to represent November a year from now.
The big advantage of using file folders for your tickler system is that they allow you to store actual documents (the form that needs CHAPTER 7 | ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS FILE-FOLDER-STYLE SAMPLE SETUP (OCTOBER 5) to be filled out on a certain day, the memo that needs to be reviewed then, the telephone note that needs action on a specific date, etc.).
The More Novel the Situation, the More Control Is Required The degree to which any of us needs to maintain checklists and external controls is directly related to our unfamiliarity with the area of responsibility.
For instance, when my wife and I decided to create a Checklists can be brand-new structure for a business we'd been highly useful to let involved with for many years, I took on areas of you know what you responsibility I'd never had to deal with before don't need to be namely, accounting, computers, marketing, legal, and concerned about.
To spark your creative thinking, here's a list of some of the topics of checklists I've seen and used over the years:  Personal Affirmations (i.e., personal value statements)  Job Areas of Responsibility (key responsibility areas)  Travel Checklist (everything to take on or do before a trip)  Weekly Review (everything to review and/or update on a weekly basis)  Training Program Components (all the things to handle when putting on an event, front to back)  Clients  Conference Checklist (everything to handle when putting on a conference)  Focus Areas (key life roles and responsibilities)  Key People in My Life/Work (relationships to assess regularly for completion and opportunity development)  Organization Chart (key people and areas of output to manage and maintain)  Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure personal balance and progress) Get comfortable with checklists, both ad hoc and more permanent.
If in fact you have now collected everything that represents an open loop in your life and work, processed each one of those items in \ PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO terms of what it means to you and what actions are required, and organized the results into a complete system that holds a current and complete overviewlarge and smallof all your present and "someday" projects, then you're ready for the next phase of implementation in the art of stress-free productivitythe review process.
If you have a list of calls you must make, for example, the minute that list is not totally current with all the calls you need to make, your brain will not trust the system, and it won't get relief from its lower-level mental tasks.
What to Look At, When Your personal system and behaviors need to be established in such a way that you can see all the action options you need to see, when you need to see them.
When you have access to a phone and any discretionary time, you ought to at least glance at the list of all the phone calls you need to make, and then either direct yourself to the best one to handle or give yourself permission to feel OK about not bothering with any of them.
When you're about to go in for a discussion with your boss or your partner, take a moment to review the outstanding agendas you have with him or her, so you'll know that you're using your time most effectively.
Then Your Action Lists After you review all your day- and time-specific commitments and handle whatever you need to about them, your next most frequent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could possibly do in your current context.
The many years I've spent Peter F. researching and implementing this methodology with countless people have proved to me that the magic key to the sustainability of the process is the Weekly Review.

If you have the luxury of an office or work space that can be somewhat isolated from the people and interactions of the day, and if you have anything resembling a typical Mondayto-Friday workweek, I recommend that you block out two hours early every Friday afternoon for the review.
The most senior and savvy of them, however, know the value of sacrificing the seemingly urgent for the truly important, and they create their Your best thoughts about work won't islands of time for some version of this process.
* As outlined in chapter 2 (pages 48-53), I have found three priority frameworks to be enormously helpful in the context of deciding actions:  The four-criteria model for choosing actions in the moment  The threefold model for evaluating daily work  The six-level model for reviewing your own work *There are various ways to give it all up.
The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment Remember that you make your action choices based on the following four criteria, in order: | | | | Context Time available Energy available Priority Let's examine each of these in the light of how you can best structure your systems and behaviors to take advantage of its dynamics.
Priority Given the context you're in and the time and energy you have, the obvious next criterion for action choice is relative priority: "Out of all my remaining options, what is the most important thing for me to do?"
That process invariably includes an often complex interplay with the goals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other significant people in your life, and with the importance of those relationships to you.
As I explained earlier, during the course of the workday, at any point in time, you'll be engaged in one of three types of activities:  Doing predefined work  Doing work as it shows up  Defining your work You may be doing things on your action lists, doing things as they come up, or processing incoming inputs to determine what work that needs to be done, either then or later, from your lists.
If you're still keeping things in your head, and if get wrapped up in you're still trying to capture only the "critical" stuff on the urgent demands of the moment than your lists, I suggest that the answer is no.
But when you've developed the skill and, habits of processing input rapidly into a rigorously defined system, it becomes CHAPTER 9 I DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES much easier to trust your judgment calls about the dance of what to do, what to stop doing, and what to do instead.
While would be to live you're on hold on the phone, you can be reviewing without your action lists and getting a sense of what you're opportunity, spontaneity, and going to do when the call is done.
You can be processing e-mails while you're on hold PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I PART TWO Do ad hoc work as it shows up, not because it is the path of least resistance, but because it is the thing you need to do, vis-a-vis all the rest.
And ultimately, in order to know whether you should stop what you're doing and do something else, you'll need to have to have a good sense of what your job requires and how that fits into the other contexts of your life.
The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work The six levels of work as we saw in chapter 2 (pages 51-53) may be thought of in terms of altitude:  50,000+feet: Life  40,000 feet: Three- to five-year visions  30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals  20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility  10,000 feet: Current projects  Runway: Current actions It makes sense that each of these levels should enhance and align with the ones above it.
If your job structure CHAPTER 9 | DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES doesn't match up with where you need to be a year from now, you should rethink how you've framed your areas of focus and responsibilities, if you want to get where you're going most efficiently.
For example, if you spend time prioritizing your work and then later discover that it's not the work you think you ought to be doing, you may have "wasted" time and energy that could have been better spent defin202 CHAPTER 9 1 DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES ing the next job you really want.
I've coached people from the top down, from both directions, and in terms of lasting value, I when the bottom is can honestly say that getting someone in control of out of control, may the details of his or her current physical world, and be the least effective approach.
The primary reason to work from this bottomup direction is that it clears the psychic decks to begin with, allowing your creative attention to focus on the more meaningful and elusive visions that you may need to challenge yourself to identify.
While the "50,000-foot level" is obviously the most important context within which to set priorities, experience has shown me that when we understand and implement all the levels of work in which we are engaged, especially the runway and 10,000-foot levels, we gain greater freedom and resources to do the bigger work that we're all about.
If you make a complete list of all of the things you want to have happen in your life and work at this level, you'll discover that there are actions you need to do that you hadn't realized.
If you were to create an accounting of those and evaluate them objectively, in terms of what you're doing and should be doing, you'll undoubtedly uncover projects you need to add to your "Projects" list.
30,000 to 50,000+ Feet Whereas the three lower levels have mostly to do with the current state of thingsyour actions, projects, and areas of responsibilityfrom here up the factors of the future and your direction and intentions are primary.
And as the job itself is a moving target, given the shifting sands of the professional world these days, there may need to be projects defined to ensure viability of the outputs in your area.
CHAPTER 9 | DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES Here are some examples of the kinds of issues that show up at this level of conversation:  The changing nature of your job, given the shifting priorities of the company.
You see yourself doing a different kind of job a year from now, and you need to make a transition out of the one you have while exploring the options for a transfer or promotion.
You can have all the other levels of your life and work shipshape, defined, and organized to a T. Still, if you're the slightest bit off course in terms of what at the deepest level you want or are called to be doing, you're going to be uncomfortable.
Perhaps you want to continue accumulating more of this kind of future thinking and would like to do the exercise with more formalityfor example, by drafting a new business plan with your partners, designing and writing out your idea of a dream life with your spouse, creating a more specific career map for the next three years for yourself, or just getting a personal coach who can lead you through those discussions and thought processes.
Most of the outcomes you have identified for your "Projects" list will not need any kind of front-end planning, other than the sort you do in your head, quickly and naturally, to come up with a next action on them.
Brainstorming Some of the projects that have your attention right now will require you to do your own free-form thinking; this is especially true of those for which you were not clear about what PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO the next action would be when you made that decision.
If you have to be in your office to do that (because that's where the files are, and you don't want to carry them around), that action should go on your "At Office" action list.

That means that as soon as you tell yourself that you should do something, if you file it only in your shortterm memory, there's a part of you that thinks you should be doing it all the time.
And that means that as soon as you've given yourself two things to do, and filed them only in your head, CHAPTER 11 I THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT you've created instant and automatic stress and failure, because you can't do them both at the same time.
